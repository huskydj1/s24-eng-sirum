Analysts suggest that other factors like competition and patent expirations may already affect revenue and profits. Some drugs on the list are not significant contributors to their company's business. Negotiated prices won't go into effect until January 2026. Lawsuits filed by drugmakers may prevent negotiated prices from being implemented. Negotiations may have a more significant impact in future rounds, especially for biologic medications. The long-term impact of negotiations could influence drug development strategies.#Medicare #DrugPrices #Negotiations #Pharmaceuticals #Competition #PatentExpirations #BiologicMedications

Why are drug prices so high in the United States compared to other industrialized nations? Because Big Pharma has the political power to write the rules of how we price drugs. Last year alone, the lobbying tab came to $225 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The result is big profits for pharmaceutical executives and their biggest investors, and higher drug prices you and me. Your thoughts?

It's very sad that so many lives have been damaged or lost to opiod addiction.  These drugs are huge money makers for the pharmacuetical companies which is why little has ever been done.  The moral of this article should be to find the cause, address the cause properly and to not to chase the symptoms with another promise in a pill.

📽 Today, we’re joining Natasha, an HCA Healthcare cardiovascular technologist, as she gives us a behind-the-scenes look at the vital care she provides patients every day in the cardiac catheterization lab (cath lab).  Cath labs are special rooms inside of our hospitals where minimally invasive tests and procedures related to the heart are performed. According to the American Heart Association, approximately every 40 seconds, someone in the United States experiences a heart attack. You may need to visit the cath lab if you are experiencing symptoms of a potential heart attack like chest pain, dizziness, fatigue or shortness of breath. When heart emergencies occur, timely cardiac care is essential to preserving heart muscle. Cardiovascular technologists work alongside clinicians to ensure heart conditions are diagnosed and treated in a timely manner. When it comes to your heart, time is muscle. HCA Healthcare cardiovascular technologists support more than 200,000 procedures performed annually within cath labs across our network of care. These procedures include cardiac catheterizations, balloon angioplasties and the placement of stents. Utilizing advanced imaging technology and expert skill, our cardiovascular technologists serve as a right hand to cardiologists who perform life-saving procedures that treat conditions such as clogged arteries or irregular heartbeats. Natasha is part of a coordinated cardiovascular team at TriStar Centennial Medical Center, which is also equipped with a Structural Heart and Valve Clinic, Advanced Heart Failure Clinic and comprehensive Aortic Center. ❤ As we round out American #HeartMonth, please join us in thanking cardiovascular technologists, like Natasha, who work behind-the-scenes in HCA Healthcare hospitals to care for the hearts of our patients. #HCAHeart #BTSAtHCAHealthcare

350 7th St. N., Naples, FL, United States, Florida
First in Florida! ☝️ NCH Rooney Heart Institute announces a groundbreaking procedure for patients with valvular heart disease. The operation performed by a highly specialized team led by Robert Cubeddu, MD, Harvard-trained interventional cardiologist and President of the NCH Rooney Heart Institute, represents the first-ever transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement performed in the State of Florida and one of ten in the country, after its recent approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The new tricuspid valve is known as the “Evoque” valve and is manufactured by Edwards Lifesciences. The self-expanding valve prosthesis is engineered from bovine pericardial tissue and is effectively delivered through a catheter inserted in the groin and maneuvered antegrade into the heart across the venous circulation. Once in position, the valve is carefully deployed replacing the function of the damaged tricuspid valve. The procedure takes approximately two hours, and most patients recover quickly and are discharged home within two to three days.“This major achievement represents not only an important milestone for our patients and our organization but underscores our overarching commitment to innovation and clinical excellence,” said Dr. Cubeddu. “As a center of excellence in valvular heart disease, we are most proud and committed in providing patients a breadth of innovative solutions with early access to breakthrough therapies. The Evoque system is no different and will enable us to evaluate and treat for many more patients with valvular heart disease.”Congratulations to Drs. David Axline, Gaston Cudemus, Brian Solomon and the Rooney Heart Institute team!🔗 https://nchmd.org/press-releases/nch-cardiologist-performs-first-transcatheter-tricuspid-valve-replacement-in-florida/
