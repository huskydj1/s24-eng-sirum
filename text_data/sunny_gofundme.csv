Medication Help,"$2,355 raised of $3,000 goal","My name is Teri.
I have fallen through the cracks of insurance, copay assistance, and medication manufacturer assistance. I live with clinical depression and this past summer went through hell trying to change to a medication that was more affordable, despite the fact that the med I was taking had kept me stable for 8 years.

Myself and my Nurse Practitioner have appealed and appealed and appealed. The insurance company simply will not cover any medication at a copay that is affordable and sustainable. I have exhausted every resource that there is--special programs that offer copay assistance, manufacturer assistance, and everything in between.

My name is Rebecca and I am creating this go fund me, for a well know friend to many of us. He is an Amazing friend, sarcastic, funny and just a very nice guy. He has been having medical issues for years now but it is getting much worse. He recently had to have a heart monitor put in, he has clots in his lungs that need to be dissolved and was told that he would possibly need a heart transplant which could cost well over a million dollars. He used all of his money for his last visit to the hospital which he was just released a couple of days ago. His prescriptions alone cost around $3600 a month and as you know he has missed and will miss quite a bit of work. Anything that you can pitch in to help him out would be greatly appreciated.

prescription costs,"$1,675 raised","Hi, guys....this is a complete embarrassment for me to ask...but recently, I have been diagnosed with a DVT, a blood clot in my left leg due to a boot I did not have to wear. I have been prescribed xarelto, and once I learned about Xarelto's costs, I begged my doctor to either get me off of it or help me with samplers, to no avail.

I am a musician and an educator, and I have undertaken a big hit over the summer months due to vacation drop-offs, lost hours at my job, and now being stuck at home due to COVID. It has been challenging to keep my bills paid. Now that I am presented with this, I am now forced with having to start a fund-raiser to fund a two-month supply of Xarelto until my student schedule gets back in order or my job offers me more hours.

If I stop using Xarelto during this period, I risk a pulmonary embolism or a stroke.

If you can help me out, I will greatly appreciate it.",[]

Diabetes Rx costs,"$1,294 raised of $1,400 goal","Hi, my name is Michael. I’ve honestly never reached out and done anything like this before for myself, but I find myself in desperation. I am currently on a prescription drug for my type 2 diabetes called Rybelsus. Many diabetes prescriptions require prior authorization from your physician, no generic versions, and very high costs. I have bounced around trying different prescriptions for years due to these issues all while my health failed to improve. Six months ago, I was put on Rybelsus which has done wonders for my health. I was able to get it at a reasonable cost due to a coupon from the manufacturer. This coupon has now changed with the start of 2023. I went to refill my prescription and was informed that even with having Blue Cross and Blue Shield along with the manufacturer coupon, my co-pay would be $1400 for a three month supply.

"Hospital costs, prescription costs, utilities.","$400 raised of $1,500 goal","Recently I was admitted to the hospital for what I thought was pulmonary edema.  We found out it was elements of congestive heart failure.  My first visit to the hospital they admitted and kept me for a week.  They found blocked arteries,  34% heart pumping capacity,  76lbs of fluid in my chest cavity and legs and diagnosed me with diabetes type 2. During that stay they placed 5 stints in and around my heart to help the arteries that were blocked and found out that my heart was completely out of rhythm and in stroke territory.  Once I was released I was given a list of medications I need to make it through this.  I was able to get most of them except for one and have yet to be able to get it.  I was off work for another week and then put on light duty so missed out on a solid portion of my paycheck.  I went back for what I was told would be a simple in and out procedure but before the procedure they found a blood clot ready to do its thing to my heart.  They placed 4 MORE stints into me and realized they would not be able to shock my heart back into rhythm while the clot is still present.  They released me the second time and gave me an absolute shopping list of prescriptions that they require me to be on to get this handled which i absolutely cannot afford.  Rent is due, utilities are due and now I have to buy meds and pay my copays. I'm supposed to go back April 3rd to see how the clot is dissolving and need to be on these medications asap.  Any and all help will be immensely immensely appreciated and welcomed.  Even if you are unable to help please share my link around as I am in a bad way.

Ayaansh Needs Expensive Drug. You Are Last Hope!!,"$244,903 raised","**Cost of the drug is over $2.1 USD million**
*$1 USD million goal in campaign running in gofundme, over $215k USD collected*
*$2.1 USD million goal in campaign running in India, over $1.7 million USD collected http://impactguru.com/s/aHvvEr*
Ayaansh fights SMA 27th May 2018- the happiest day in the life of Rupal and Yogesh Gupta, the day their son was born. With tears of happiness in their eyes, they named their kid Ayaansh. As their lives began with their new addition to the family, at around 6 months of age, they realized that little Ayaansh was missing the milestones which were usually achieved by other kids his age. He hadn’t started crawling or wasn’t sitting up. They started reading about why this could be happening and thought that it would just be a normal delay and eventually it would happen. Little did they know that something far more severe is happening in their son’s body.



When he didn’t have the control to even hold up his neck at 8 months of age, the parents were worried and took him to Rainbow Children’s Hospital. There, after countless consultations and appointments with multiple specialists, the parents found out that Ayaansh is suffering from SMA, a life-limiting condition where for the majority of children (approximately 95%) life expectancy is less than 18 months. “We felt our lives were shattered when the doctors said that he will not live for more than 4-6 years.”

Currently, Ayaansh is of 2 years and 8 months of age and has a chest deformation called pigeon’s chest. He requires physiotherapy daily for at least 4-5 hours. Completely on a liquid diet, he is unable to swallow properly and on a good day he throws up whatever he eats twice. On an average day, he vomits around 5 times. He needs BiPAP support for breathing for 12 hours a day and often suffers from sleep apnea. Even when he has a cough the little boy needs a tube i.e. catheter to remove the phlegm.

There is only a ray of hope for the little boy, the world’s most expensive medicine – Zolgensma. This is the ideal time for little Ayaansh to take the medicine as it is only approved for children who have a bodyweight of fewer than 13.5 kilograms. Ayaansh’s weight is 10 kilograms. But the world’s most expensive medicine is not possible to arrange for a middle-class couple like the Guptas. 16 crores is an impossible amount to arrange.

World's costliest drug is Rehansh's only hope,"$46,636 raised of $2,100,000 goal","Imagine if you woke up in the middle of the night. You wish to move but you can’t, no matter how much you try. Sounds scary right? Sadly this is the condition of 9-month-old Rehansh who has Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1. The day he was diagnosed, a price was stamped on the child’s life.





It is a genetic disease affecting the entire nervous system, peripheral nervous system, and hence voluntary muscle movement. Maximum nerve cells that control muscles are located in the spinal cord, which accounts for the word spinal in the name of the disease. 







Our Motive is to give him a Fulfilling and Long Lifespan, but the cost of which is something we cannot bear. So does that mean we will lose our child?

We all need to come together in his fight against SMA and donate whatever possible to reach this goal as soon as possible, because time is very crucial since Zolgensma can only sold and administered to patients less than 2 years. Rehansh needs this treatment urgently and we need your help, support, and prayers to save him from a battle he is fighting everyday for his life.

Please find Rehansh's complete medical report here -



Please donate whatever you can spare. Every donation will count towards saving Rehansh and giving him a chance at living a good and fulfilling life. Alone the parents cannot bear to save little Rehash but together it is not impossible. The times are hard for everyone, and we're forever grateful for your help. Even if you're unable to donate, please share this as much as you can on social media and make this miracle happen.

We are in for the long haul in our fight against this deadly disease. The best course of action is to raise awareness and get the necessary infrastructure set up to reduce the cost of treatment. Only time and continuous lobbying will contribute to long-lasting change.

One of the best feelings in the world is Saving a Life. Your donation will not only help our son live his life but will help us preserve our Family. Thank you all in advance for your support and contributions. We're forever grateful to you all.

Rise Up for Rhys,"$403,470 raised of $500,000 goal","Baby Rhys was diagnosed with SMA at 6 months old and needed a life saving drug that cost $2.1 million. She was able to get Zolgensma in August of 2020 and has responded well to the treatment. Thankfully, much of the cost of this expensive drug was covered by insurance. Funds raised here will continue to go towards the many remaining costs for Rhys’s ongoing care including co-pays and deductibles, doctors visits, physical therapy, mobility equipment, ADA adjustments to the Devine’s home to accommodate and supports Rhys’s mobility, and to continue to spread awareness of SMA so that other babies receive diagnosis and treatment before it’s too late. Thank you for your support. Follow Rhys’s story and current updates on Instagram @RiseUpForRhys

In May of 2019 while on vacation in Scotland, Rory and I found out we were pregnant (though I already knew - mother’s intuition kicks in early!)  Our baby girl was due on Christmas Day, and after a perfectly healthy pregnancy and 20 hours of labor, we welcomed her 3 weeks early on December 4, 2019 at 12:13pm. Even though I had sworn not to give my children confusing-to-pronounce Welsh names as my mother had done to me, we decided to name her Rhys (pronounced Reese).


Rhys had been a healthy baby, loving her baths, walks outside, and cuddles and kisses from her doggies. As Rhys approached 4 months, that mother’s intuition was nagging me - I noticed that she seemed to be falling behind on milestones other babies her age were hitting. She always struggled with tummy time, and wasn’t able to roll over or hold her head up for very long. At her 4 month check up, our pediatrician said she just had low muscle tone and recommended physical therapy. a genetic condition we had never heard of before. 


A quick Google search, confirmed every parent’s greatest fear: ""The number 1 genetic disease that kills most babies up to 2 years old."" Appointments with Geneticists and Pediatric Neuro-muscular Specialists were set, blood and saliva tests ordered, and the waiting began. We hoped it was something else less severe, easier to treat, less devastating. ANYTHING but SMA. After 2 weeks, the longest 2 weeks of our lives, we received the heartbreaking diagnosis - Rhys has SMA Type 1, the most severe form of the disease.


SMA is a terminal muscle degenerative disease, affecting eating, speaking, moving and even breathing. It results in muscle wasting where infants often die of respiratory failure before reaching the age of two. It is so rare that just a few years ago, there was no treatment. Parents had to watch as their child was able to move less and less, becoming unable to eat and breath on their own.

One treatment, SPINRAZA, works on the SMN2 gene, which is a less active copy of the SMN1 gene (the gene that is missing/non-functioning in a person with SMA). By boosting production of SMN2, SPINRAZA supports muscle development and provides a level of improvement. SPINRAZA is very expensive at $750K in the first year and $375K every year thereafter for life. In August of 2019, a new gene therapy, ZOLGENSMA was approved by the FDA. It replaces the missing/non-functioning SMN1 gene with a new functional copy. This medicine provides life changing improvement, some patients are even able to walk independently. Such a miracle drug comes at a cost, and ZOLGENSMA is the most expensive drug in the world at $2.1 million USD.


Because SMA Type 1 is aggressive and degenerative, this is a race against time. With each day that passes, motor neurons in Rhys’ sweet little body are becoming inactive. All funds raised will go to Rhys’s medical care including gene therapy (out-of-pocket responsibility outside of insurance not known at this time), physical and occupational therapy, mobility and development equipment, etc. She has a lifetime ahead of her and will need continuous treatment for the best chance at a full life. In the case there are additional funds beyond Rhys’s needs, they will go to Cure SMA, an organization dedicated to raising awareness for this devastating disease. 

Every child should have the best possible chance at life - please join us to surround our happy little girl in love and support.

Extraordinary Medical Costs for Little Ayah,"$1,644,421 raised","I'm Kati Wilkins, and recently a dear friend from my days living in Sweden reached out to me about a colleague's daughter who has a rare genetic disorder. Beautiful Ayah just turned 1 this January, and needs help getting treatment for her disorder. The family lives next-door in Denmark, and the most effective treatment is currently not approved in her country, so she hopes to bring her daughter here to the US for treatment. The problem is, the treatment she needs is one of the most expensive in the world! 

This GoFundMe account is to help Ayah's family raise the funding needed for her treatment and associated travel expenses. Times are tough for everyone, but if you're able to spare some extra funds, please do so. Also, please share this story widely.  Also, please be sure to read their story below. Anything you can give helps! We are trying to raise for , so any help you can give will go a long ways.


This is  (born on ), a bubbly little princess who likes to smile a lot. Ayah has a rare genetic and degenerative disorder called

 is a rare genetic disease that affects the central nervous system, voluntary skeletal muscle movement, and the peripheral nervous system (the connection between the central nervous system and the rest of the body). As a result,  affects basic motor functions such as walking, hand movements and  feeding. After  progression, the patients lose the ability to swallow, breathe and eventually die.

Since the diagnosis,  has been put on Spinraza, a prescription drug administered as a spinal injection throughout a patient’s life. Spinraza increases the ability of the  (which is a back up of the -the one that  is missing) to produce protein which in turn improves motor functions and survival.

 is a  gene therapy treatment for kids under the age of 2. It  the missing  with a new, working copy that helps motor neuron cells work properly and survive but it’s currently the most expensive drug in the world at $2.1 million. It is NOT a cure since it does not reverse damage already caused by SMA before treatment. However, with supportive therapy, it has by far shown the best results. It is recommended that the earlier the patient receives the treatment, the better.

We are fortunate and  to the Danish healthcare system for giving  Spinraza. However as parents, we cannot leave the approval of gene therapy in Denmark to chance and hope that, it will be ready before Ayah turns 2 years old. As any parent, we wish the best for our child, but even more so in regards to her health. Besides  only having to be , it has  in clinical testing.




The goal is to raise enough funds (15 million DKK)to cover the costs of the gene-therapy treatment  and additional expenses like travel, consultation fee and accomodation during her treatment abroad.  By giving Ayah this treatment, we hope to give her an almost normal childhood where she will be able to play with her big sister without any major obstacle.

World's costliest drug for baby Ayansh,"€2,174 raised of €500,000 goal","Update 1 :-
Dear Donors
Thank you very much for your generous contributions towards Baby Ayansh. A few weeks ago the mere thought of arranging Rs 16 crores sent shivers down our spine. However, your outpour of love and support has turned that fear into faith as now we believe that Ayansh’s life will be saved with the help of kind souls like you. 
Ayansh has to do physiotherapy on a regular basis. This is very important for him as he has to maintain the remaining muscle function he has. 
———————————
Ayansh's CONDITION

My cousin, baby Ayansh, at a very early age, is diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy. The disorder attacks the baby’s nerves and muscles, and as it progresses, makes it extremely difficult for them to carry out basic activities like sit up, lift their head, swallow milk, and even breathe.




SMA affects 1 in 10,000 babies and is the #1 genetic cause of infant death worldwide.




We, as Ayansh's parents, want to give him, a lively and happy childhood, his best chance to not only survive but also live a fulfilled, long and normal life.




TREATMENT OPTIONS IN INDIA

As of now, there are no treatment options available in India for this invisible killer. Our only hope for Ayansh to have a normal life is to be able to import Zolgensma, a one-time gene replacement therapy, which in his current state could be a potential “cure”.

Donate money. Please donate with your heart so we can save our Ayansh's life.
Contribute your time. We are in for the long haul in our fight against this deadly disease. The best course of action is to raise awareness and get the necessary infrastructure set up in India. Only time and continuous lobbying will contribute to long-lasting change.
Spread the word. Healthy parents could have a genetically affected baby. Genetic testing is in a nascent state in India, with limited labs and clinics available for diagnosis. Tell others about genetic testing, so this becomes a common practice as it is in most western countries like USA and Canada, where genetic screening is part of post-natal care.

"The recovery from addiction,help with legal costs",$450 raised,"Hi, my name is Alex Chapman and I’m raising money to help with my recovery from addiction and it’s toll on my life. I’ve been struggling with hard drugs since 2017 and it’s taken everything from me. In 2018, I was arrested for drug charges and larceny and subsequently sent to prison. The justice system saw fit to send me to a high level penitentiary and I never had the opportunity to receive drug treatment. In prison due to my size I was targeted for extortion and sexually assaulted more than once. When I was released, I relapsed and violated my probation. They sent me back for 21 more months to a higher security prison and there the abuse was horrendous. I witnessed men murdered and was raped multiple times. This was a trauma I never wish on my worst enemy. This is also very difficult because I’ve never opened up to even my family about my abuse. This trauma has made life for me so hard due to not being able maintain a job, and suicidal thoughts and attempts, social anxiety, and fear of people. My mental health exacerbated by my PTSD, anxiety, and major depression impact my social life. I use to deal with my fear of the the same happening to me again. It’s given me a false confidence to face people. However, I’ve reached a point where I need help more than ever. My drug abuse became much worse since my release recently and I am genuinely trying to change my life. However, due to my inability to maintain sobriety, probation has violated me once again. I know I can’t maintain this anymore and I want to face these demons. I want my sanity back and I want to be clean. My financial situation is dire and my family has my brothers to care for so their finances are tight as well. I’m asking for help to not only pay for a lawyer, but to get treatment at a rehab and pay for counseling, housing, medications, and to start my new journey. I’m proud to say I’m 54 days clean and doing well. Please help me begin to heal from my wounds and bring attention to our flawed system. I’m a young, non- violent drug addict who had a short sentence and they sent me to a place that houses murderers, rapists, violent criminals, and death row inmates to be extorted, raped, and beaten by men with nothing to lose! Our system needs change and it starts with you! Thank you for your support and God bless you all!

Jacob and Brooke's Medical Expenses,"$21,775 raised of $30,000 goal","My nephew, Jacob, was admitted to the hospital on February 1st with kidney failure.

After suffering from what seemed like a bad stomach bug for a couple of days, Jacob went to urgent care. At urgent care, Jacob's blood pressure was extremely high and he was sent to the ER. After several hours of high blood pressure readings and a bunch of blood work showing very abnormal kidney blood levels, he was admitted to WakeMed Cary where he spent the past 11 days. Jacob was treated for high blood pressure and eventually began dialysis to improve his condition. He also underwent a kidney biopsy to determine the cause of his kidney failure.

ALS and it's financial burden,"$925 raised of $30,000 goal","Hi, My name is Molly I am the wife and caretaker of my husband. He was diagnosed with ALS in September of 2021. He worked up until he couldn't which was around March of 2022. We have 7 kids altogether we are a blended family, 5 kids in the home. I had to stop working in May because he simply cannot be left alone. He has lost use of his hands, his speech has been terrible a while now, and now his legs are going. He is sacrificing his body and time doing experimental treatments, in hopes of finding a cure. Not just for him, but for anyone in the ALS Community (PALS). He is on his second round of experimental treatments at John Hopkins. Also he is committed to keeping doing the experiments as long as his body will allow him to do so. Durning this experimental treatment we have to travel to John Hopkins once a week. Every other week we have to stay in the hospital for 8 hours when he receives the drug or the placebo we don't know. It gets injected into his spine. I've waited 7 months to become his paid caretaker, which is barely anything and they only give me 24.5 hours a week. We only get social security for him they won't give it to us for our kids. We are scraping by the skin of our teeth at this point. We've had one person help us out, it's just not enough. Also our vehicle needs about $3,000 worth of work done that's just in labor we already bought the parts. Me and my family would appreciate any support if you are able to donate. It is very hard for us to ask for help especially from strangers, it's just at that swallow your pride point. Bless you all and your families, stay well!

Let's help Matt cover the cost of his Treatment,"$26,347 AUD raised of $20,000 goal","Hi, my name is Sharon and I'm fundraising to help cover the cost of medical expenses for a great guy named Matt King. In all honesty, I have only know Matt for a little over 2 years now, when he came into my good friend Caroline's life and changed it for the better. Whilst I have only known Matt for a relatively short time, It didn't take long for me to see what an amazing, caring, loving and genuine guy he is.

As you may know, Matt has recently been diagnosed with Metastatic Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS), which is an extremely rare cancer. Matt's treatment plan involves Radiotherapy which he is doing privately in order to get treatment quickly, and therefore has out of pocket costs for Matt to pay himself. In addition to radiotherapy, Matt will start on Tecentriq (Atezolizumab) which is an immunotherapy drug that has only recently been approved for use in ASPS patients in America. As it is not approved for Matts type of cancer in Australia, it is not on the PBS schedule and therefore Matt will have to pay the full cost himself, with each vial costing $6747.37 on top of the radiotherapy out of pocket costs.

Fund access to drugs for Jack's cancer treatment,"$247,465 AUD raised of $500,000 goal","This is Jack…or Jack Jack as he’s known to his family and friends.

In April of 2023, he was like any other curious boundary pushing three year old. He wanted to be a dolphin when he grew up. He was happiest when playing with his brother Ted, making cups of tea in his kitchen and watching old school Scooby Doo and Smurfs. His favourite colour was yellow. Then he came home with a limp.

Three weeks later, four doctors walked into our room to advise us our baby bear had stage IV cancer. Neuroblastoma.
Whilst Jack had been playing, swimming, sleeping, laughing and giving “huggles” his nerves cells had failed to mature properly, resulting in a mandarin sized tumour growing near his adrenal gland and kidney. From there it spread to lymph nodes, bone marrow and his bones, from the top of his beautiful head down to his toes.

Help Robin access life prolonging drugs.,"£120 raised of £1,000 goal","Hi my name is Theresa and I am creating a fundraiser for 17 year old Robin. She is the daughter of an old school friend of mine. They live in South Africa where health care is privately funded and access to treatment of any sort is not always straight forward. And certainly not a ‘given’, that when needed, all treatment options will be made available to you free of charge. Thus far, Robin has endured a gruelling 18 months of major surgery, chemotherapy (with awful side effects) scans, tests, more tests and difficult conversations with specialists. Access to the palliative drugs described in the YouTube video will give Robin and her family more time. So please, please donate, and help this amazing young woman.

Help Ibrahim access lifesaving medicine,€382 raised,"Hi, my name is Rida and I am pursuing my master's in political communication from the University of Amsterdam on an Erasmus Mundus scholarship. My cousin, Ibrahim residing in Pakistan is suffering from a rare genetic disorder, SMA (Spinal Muscular Atrophy) type 2 which affects the motor neurons of the body and leads to the weakening of muscles, resulting in his inability to walk. His disease is progressive and the doctors have declared his condition threatening to the extent that he might not live long enough to celebrate his 18th birthday. As this is a rare genetic disorder affecting very few people, there was no medication available in Pakistan up until 2021.

Roche pharmaceutical is now the only organization in Pakistan that is providing medication for this very rare disease. Under their Compassionate Use Program, they provided free medication (called Risdiplam) to Ibrahim in August 2021. However, starting this year (2023) the program has terminated, and Ibrahim is not able to access this life-saving drug for this progressive, dangerous disease.

Help Trast get into drug Treatment!,"$8,170 raised of $7,500 goal","On August 23 of 2014, Trast first ran away. We struggled to find him and succeeded less than a month later on September 17 to bring him home and get him into a treatment center. That time around, the out of pocket expenses were too much when the insurance company decided he didn't need treatment anymore.

We went through great efforts to get him cleaned up and he even went back to Wisconsin for a few months after his treatment to spend time under the thumb of his wise AA Grandpa. He did well during that time, but little did we know that he planned to run away again the moment he got back to LA. 

This time, Trast was on the run for over a year, living on the streets of Southern California, and they were not kind to him. Trast suffered a brutal accident at one point, costing him most of a finger and a month in the hospital in order to receive a sequence of three suguries.

We lost all contact with him during this time, as did even his closest friends and we feared the worst. Hope was revived when the photo of him surfaced on the . While it was clear that his addiction to meth had taken hold of him, at least we knew he was alive.


Through contacting  and the , we learned that he was in fact still in LA and our intense search instantly resumed. He was found once again on Monday March 14 , 2016, as a wonderful birthday gift to his mother, and we're looking to get him back into treatment.

Fortunately, he wants the help he needs and we're very optimistic. His one request of his mother as he goes back into treatment this time is that he have regular access to her and his brother.

Help with costs of medications and monthly bills,"$575 raised of $5,000 goal","Hi, I'm Stacey and I'm fundraising to help cover monthly necessities for my stepfather and mother.
As many know, Gary was diagnosed with Stage IV lung cancer. He has been very sick and not able to work any longer. My mom has been the only source of income for them.
Her work hours have been tremendously shortened because of having to take him to treatments, daily.
Gary was recently given permission to seek outside treatment from the VA, however, the VA will not cover the costs of his medications, and that is the only health insurance he has. One medication is his anti-nausea medication and it is about $200 without a prescription, and it's a medication he needs.
Any help that will be given will go directly to cover the costs of his medications and towards monthly bills.",[]
Medication cost for Charleigh,"$465 raised of $1,600 goal",I am doing a fundraiser for a medication that our 14 year old daughter needs for her Epilepsy. We have tried many resources with no luck.

The medication is $1250.00 and she also needs seizure rescue meds that are $200 with our insurance. One of these are left with the school nurse. Any amount will help. She only has 2 days worth of this medication left Please share. Thank you ❤️,[]
To help cover costs medication and travel expenses,"$4,180 CAD raised of $10,000 goal","Hi, my name is Stephanie Taylor and I am fundraising for some support for a dear man to me Bill MacQuarrie. Bill MacQuarrie has been a diabetic for many years but recently diagnosed with stage 5 kidney disease and going through CT scans for the lungs as a mass has been detected. Bill hasn’t smoked for about 40 years. He has been an underground miner for the last 40 years in Flin Flon, Manitoba and has since retired. Ever since then it seems like life has just thrown him one curve ball after another. It breaks my heart to see such a strong man so vulnerable. Bill is the strongest and most selfless man I know. He is a wonderful father, husband, grandfather, uncle, brother and friend! His children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews mean the world to him. We all wish we could take away his pain and heal his condition. Unfortunately, we can’t and his medical coverage doesn't, cover the costs of all his medications and travel expenses. We live in a remote community and his doctors who have been amazing are 6 hours away. He is receiving a lot of support from friends and family but there is only so much we can do. There is a lot of traveling due to appointments, monthly medication bills that his pension and benefits just doesn’t cover. If you are able to help donate to help relief some stresses of this amazing family, anything would be appreciated. All the money will go directly to Bill and Elaine to cover there expenses.
