1,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7311400/,abstract,"Global spending on prescription drugs in 2020 is expected to be ~$1.3 trillion; the United States alone will spend ~$350 billion1. These high spending rates are expected to increase at a rate of 3–6% annually worldwide. The magnitude of increase is even more alarming for cancer treatments that account for a large proportion of prescription drug costs. In 2018, global spending on cancer treatments was approximately 150 billion, and has increased by >10% in each of the past 5 years2.The high cost of prescription drugs threatens healthcare budgets, and limits funding available for other areas in which public investment is needed. In countries without universal healthcare, the high cost of prescription drugs poses an additional threat: unaffordable out-of-pocket costs for individual patients. Approximately 25% of Americans find it difficult to afford prescription drugs due to high out-of-pocket costs3. Drug companies cite high drug prices as being important for sustaining innovation. But the ability to charge high prices for every new drug possibly slows the pace of innovation. It is less risky to develop drugs that represent minor modifications of existing drugs (“me-too” drugs) and show incremental improvement in efficacy or safety, rather than investing in truly innovative drugs where there is a greater chance of failure."

3,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10055471/,abstract,"Xylazine is an alpha-2 agonist increasingly prevalent in the illicit drug supply. Our objectives were to curate information about xylazine through social media from People Who Use Drugs (PWUDs). Specifically, we sought to answer the following: 1) what are the demographics of Reddit subscribers reporting exposure to xylazine? 2) is xylazine a desired additive? and 3) what adverse effects of xylazine are PWUDs experiencing?Natural Language Processing (NLP) was used to identify mentions of “xylazine” from posts by Reddit subscribers who also posted on drug-related subreddits. Posts were qualitatively evaluated for xylazine-related themes. A survey was developed to gather additional information about the Reddit subscribers. This survey was posted on subreddits that were identified by NLP to contain xylazine-related discussions from March 2022 to October 2022.76 posts mentioning xylazine were extracted via NLP from 765,616 posts by 16,131 Reddit subscribers (January 2018 to August 2021). People on Reddit described xylazine as an unwanted adulterant in their opioid supply. 61 participants completed the survey. Of those that disclosed their location, 25/50 (50%) participants reported locations in the Northeastern United States. The most common eoute of xylazine use was intranasal use (57%). 31/59 (53%) reported experiencing xylazine withdrawal. Frequent adverse events reported were prolonged sedation (81%) and increased skin wounds (43%).Among respondents on these Reddit forums, xylazine appears to be an unwanted adulterant. PWUDs may be experiencing adverse effects such as prolonged sedation and xylazine withdrawal. This appeared to be more common in the Northeast."

5,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10338828/,abstract,"In 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (Descovy) as another option for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) prevention for high-risk adults and adolescents. With the introduction of this new PrEP, millions of current users on emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada), another PrEP medication currently used to prevent HIV transmission, have options of whether to continue their current treatment regime or transition to new treatment options. The objective of this study was to conduct a descriptive analysis to characterize user-generated social media conversations on Reddit associated with FDA-approved PrEP prevention treatment options. Key themes identified were associated with perceptions, knowledge, and attitudes associated with the transition of use of different PrEP medications. Data were collected retrospectively and prospectively from the Reddit platform for posts with keywords filtered for HIV, PrEP, and FDA-approved PrEP prevention treatment from October 2020 to December 2020. We chose the Reddit platform based on prior studies that have identified PrEP user conversations and insights on access challenges for specific AIDS communities, such as gays and men who have sex with men (MSM). Reddit posts were then manually annotated using an inductive content coding approach for key themes regarding the transition of use and other emergent themes from user-generated content. Formal coding of text data was conducted with refined codes, and sub-codes created. A total of 3,120 posts were analyzed from Reddit resulting in 315 posts that were coded for PrEP and 105 posts (33.33%) specific to user discussions regarding the transition of PrEP prevention. Overall, users expressed interest in drug switching to Descovy, particularly in the context of poorer adherence or concerns about existing side effects associated with Truvada. Other major themes included discussions about the cost of Descovy, apprehension about side effects in comparison to Truvada, insurance coverage changes, and discussions about the donation of Truvada to other users after transitioning. Among these discussions, topics related to sexual minorities, including MSM, reported concerns when considering a switch in their HIV prevention regime. Understanding the changing public perception associated with the introduction of new HIV prevention is important in the context of market access, patient safety, pharmacovigilance, and health equity, particularly among high-risk populations such as MSM. Results support the use of social media from a digital pharmacovigilance perspective to better understand emerging HIV prevention, treatment, and adherence challenges experienced by patients."

8,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8678390/,abstract,"This paper uses a social media platform, Reddit, to identify real-time experiences of people who use drugs during the COVID-19 lock-down.Reddit is a popular and growing social media platform, providing a large, publicly available dataset necessary for high performance of machine learning and topic modeling techniques. We used opioid-related “subreddits,” communities where Reddit users engage in conversations about drug use, to examine COVID-19-related content of posts and comments from March to May 2020. This paper investigates the latent topics of users’ posts/comments using Latent Dirichlet Allocation, an unsupervised machine learning approach that uncovers the thematic structure of a document collection. We also examine how topics changed over time.The final dataset consists of 525 posts and 9284 comments, for a total of 9809 posts/comments (3756 posts/comments in r/opiates, 1641 in r/OpiatesRecovery, 1203 in r/suboxone, and 3209 in r/Methadone) among 2342 unique individuals. There were 5256 posts/comments in March; 3185 in April; and 1368 in May (until May 22). Topics that appeared most frequently in COVID-19-related discussions included medication for opioid use disorder experiences and access issues (22.6%), recovery (24.2%), and drug withdrawal (20.2%).During the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic, people who use drugs were impacted in several ways, including forced or intentional withdrawal, confusion between withdrawal and COVID-19 symptoms, take-home medication for opioid use disorder issues, and barriers to recovery. As the pandemic progresses, providers and policymakers should consider these experiences among people who use drugs during the early stage of the pandemic."

As localities enforce lockdowns and pass emergency OUD treatment regulations, questions arise about how these changes will affect access and retention in care. In this study, we explore the influence of COVID-19 on access to, experiences with, and motivations for OUD treatment through a qualitative analysis of public discussion forums on Reddit.We collected data from Reddit, a free and international online platform dedicated to public discussions and user-generated content. We extracted 1000 of the most recent posts uploaded between March 5th and May 13th, 2020 from each of the two most popular opioid subreddits “r/Opiates” and “r/OpiatesRecovery” (total 2000). We reviewed posts for relevance to COVID-19 and opioid use and coded content using a hybrid inductive-deductive approach. Thematic analysis identified common themes related to study questions of interest.Of 2000 posts reviewed, 300 (15%) discussed topics related to the intersection of opioid use and COVID-19. Five major themes related to OUD treatment were identified: Concern about closure of OUD treatment services; transition to telehealth and virtual care; methadone treatment requirements and increased exposure to COVID-19; reactions to changing regulations on medications for OUD; and influences of the pandemic on treatment motivation and progress.In the face of unprecedented challenges due to COVID-19, reactions of Reddit opioid forum users ranged from increased distress in accessing and sustaining treatment, to encouragement surrounding new modes of treatment and opportunities to engage in care. New and less restrictive avenues for treatment were welcomed by many, but questions remain about how new norms and policy changes will be sustained beyond this pandemic and impact OUD treatment access and outcomes long-term."

14,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10334893/,abstract,"Crowdfunding for medical costs is becoming increasingly popular. Few previous studies have described the fundraising characteristics and qualities associated with success.This study aimed to characterize and investigate the qualities associated with successful dermatological fundraisers.This cross-sectional study of dermatological GoFundMe campaigns collected data, including demographic variables, thematic variables using an inductive qualitative method, and quantitative information. Linear regression examined the qualities associated with success, which are defined based on funds raised when controlling for campaign goals. Logistic regression was used to examine qualities associated with extremely successful campaigns, defined as those raising >1.5 times the IQR. Statistical significance was set at P<.05.A total of 2008 publicly available campaigns at the time of data collection were evaluated. Nonmodifiable factors associated with greater success included male gender, age 20-40 years, and White race. Modifiable factors associated with success included more updates posted to the campaign page, non–self-identity of the campaign creator, mention of a chronic condition, and smiling in campaign profile photographs.Understanding the modifiable factors of medical crowdfunding may inform future campaigns, and nonmodifiable factors may have policy implications for improving health care equity and financing. Crowdfunding for medical disease treatment may have potential implications for medical privacy and exacerbation of existing health care disparities. This study was limited to publicly available GoFundMe campaigns. Potential limitations for this study include intercoder variability, misclassification bias because of the data abstraction process, and prioritization of campaigns based on the proprietary GoFundMe algorithm."

17,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9055489/,abstract,"Individuals in need of medical care turn to crowdfunding websites to engage a “crowd” or group for financial support. In the last decade, access to insulin has decreased considerably for several reasons, including the rising cost of insulin, increasing popularity of high-deductible insurance plans, and increasing insurance premiums. Many people with diabetes are forced to ration or go without insulin, and they turn to crowdfunding websites to seek financial donations to purchase insulin needed to reduce health risks and mortality, and sustain quality of life. This study aimed to explore crowdfunding campaign requests to purchase insulin in the United States.In this retrospective, quantitative, and qualitative study, we coded the text of GoFundMe online crowdfunding campaigns and viral measures (shares, hearts, and comments) from February 25 to April 15, 2019. We described campaigns (N=205) and explored the factors associated with campaign success using correlations and qualitative thematic analysis.The majority of campaigns were initiated by middle-aged adults (age 26-64 years; 77/205, 37.6%), those with type 1 diabetes (94/205, 45.9%), and those needing funds owing to insurance coverage issues (125/205, 61.0%). The factors associated with campaign success included requests for ≤US $500 (P=.007) and higher viral measures (shares, P=.007; hearts, P<.001; comments, P=.002). The following 4 themes emerged from the campaign text: (1) desire for self-management and survival, (2) diabetes management untenable given insulin access, (3) aftermath of insulin unaffordability, and (4) privacy issues with crowdfunding. Campaign comments were both supportive (tangible, informational, and emotional) and unsupportive (questioned the need for the campaign and deemed crowdfunding inappropriate).Despite crowdfunding websites being used to support the purchase of insulin, campaigns raised only a fraction of the money requested. Therefore, GoFundMe campaigns are not a reliable solution to obtain funds for insulin in the United States. Applying quantitative and qualitative methods is adequate to analyze online crowdfunding for costs of medications such as insulin. However, it is critical for people with diabetes to use resources other than online crowdfunding to access and obtain insulin owing to low success rates. Clinicians should routinely assess difficulty accessing or affording insulin, and federal health care policies should support lowering the cost of insulin."

20,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6366487/,abstract,"Myriad anecdotes—of a Nobel laureate who sold his medal to pay medical bills,1 or the more than 250 000 GoFundMe medical campaigns last year2—attest to the financial toll of illness on American families. National surveys confirm that medical bills frequently cause financial hardship,3 and the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reported that they were by far the most common cause of unpaid bills sent to collection agencies in 2014, accounting for more than half of all such debts.4Less evidence is available on the medical causes of bankruptcy, a public and stigmatizing confession of impoverishment. In surveys conducted by researchers with the Consumer Bankruptcy Project in 20015 and 2007,6 a majority of recently bankrupt debtors implicated medical bills or illness-related work loss as causes of their bankruptcy, findings that President Obama used to argue for passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA both expanded and upgraded health insurance coverage, banning preexisting illness exclusions, imposing a cap on out-of-pocket spending, and mandating coverage for essential benefits. Although these reforms might attenuate the risk of medical bankruptcy, increasing medical costs and stagnant incomes could have the opposite effect.We sought to assess the incidence of medical bankruptcy in the current era using methods similar to those employed by the Consumer Bankruptcy Project in its 2001 and 2007 surveys. From court records of all US bankruptcy filers from 2013 to 2016, we randomly sampled 200 each quarter, abstracted their court record data, and (with institutional review board approval) mailed them a questionnaire closely modeled on the questionnaires used in those earlier studies.5,6Of the 3200 surveys we mailed, the postal service returned 108 as undeliverable and 910 debtors responded, for a response rate of 29.4%. Court records indicated that nonrespondents’ financial characteristics mostly resembled those of respondents; their median net worth was similar (–$32 947 vs –$30 409; P = .17), as were their assets, debts, and ongoing medical expenses (P > .05 for all comparisons), although nonrespondents had slightly higher monthly incomes ($2750 vs $2489; P < .001).Table 1 displays debtors’ responses regarding the (often multiple) contributors to their bankruptcy. The majority (58.5%) “very much” or “somewhat” agreed that medical expenses contributed, and 44.3% cited illness-related work loss; 66.5% cited at least one of these two medical contributors—equivalent to about 530 000 medical bankruptcies annually.Share of Debtors Citing Specific Contributors to Their Bankruptcy: United States, 2013–2016Note. The sample size of the survey was n = 910.The share of debtors reporting a medical contributor before the ACA’s January 1, 2014 implementation (65.5%) and after implementation (67.5%) was similar (P = .37). Both of these figures are close to the 62.1% estimate from the 2007 survey, and in a difference-in-differences analysis we found no evidence that trends differed between states that did versus did not accept the ACA’s Medicaid expansion (P = .76). The responses regarding individual items in the current survey are also similar to those in 2007, when 57.1% of debtors cited medical bills as contributors to their bankruptcy and 40.3% cited income loss due to illness.6Among those we surveyed from 2013 to 2016, medical debtors were more likely than other respondents to live with a spouse or partner but were similar in age, gender, and likelihood of being uninsured. Medical debtors more frequently self-reported fair or poor health (odds ratio [OR] = 2.88; P < .001), major disability (OR = 2.52; P < .001), foregoing needed medical attention in the two years prior to the bankruptcy filing (OR = 1.77; P < .001), and foregoing needed medications (OR = 2.65; P < .001).Like all surveys, ours relies on respondents’ candor. Moreover, the modest response rate—17.1% lower than the response rate in the 2007 study—mandates cautious interpretation of our current findings. However, the similarities between respondents and nonrespondents is reassuring. Even if the medical bankruptcy rate among nonrespondents were half that of respondents, the overall rate would exceed 40%.Our findings contrast with those of a recent study analyzing the financial sequelae of hospitalization in California from 2003 to 2007.7 That study found that hospitalization increased medical debts and decreased employment and income, but it suggested that medical bankruptcies were uncommon. However, its econometric approach rests on four assumptions likely to underestimate the medical bankruptcy rate. First, its cohort excluded most persons with frequent hospitalizations, a group at high risk of medical bankruptcy. Second, it assumed that only hospitalized patients can suffer a medical bankruptcy, although patients hospitalized in the course of a year account for only 18.2% of out-of-pocket costs paid by US households (Himmelstein and Woolhandler, unpublished analysis of data from the 2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey). Third, it assumed that a child’s, elderly parent’s, or other relative’s illness never causes a bankruptcy. Finally, the study’s assumption that every bankrupting illness starts at the moment of an initial hospitalization is contradicted by its cohort’s upsloping rate of bankruptcy filings in the baseline period prior to hospitalization. Because bankruptcy rates do not rise with age, this suggests that financial distress from illness frequently predated hospitalization. Because the study estimated medical bankruptcies from changes in filing trends before versus after hospitalization, failure to account for the upsloping baseline probably introduced a substantial downward bias.The California study’s authors argued that survey-based ascertainment of the causes of bankruptcy is unreliable, because debtors cannot know the true cause of their financial predicament—just as heart attack patients cannot know what caused their illness.7 Yet in our (D. U. H. and S. W.) clinical experience, most such patients can accurately identify the smoking, dietary habits, and family history that put them at risk. Moreover, debtors are peculiarly well positioned to identify the contributors to the bankruptcy. As part of their bankruptcy proceedings, all of our respondents had recently prepared detailed documentation of their assets, debts, and current finances, and had sworn to its accuracy.Medical bankruptcy has garnered public attention because it resonates with the abuse that Americans—including many middle-class Americans—suffer at the hands of our health care finance system. Despite gains in coverage and access to care from the ACA, our findings suggest that it did not change the proportion of bankruptcies with medical causes. That’s not surprising because the chronically poor—the group most affected by the ACA’s coverage expansion—have reduced access to credit, have few assets (such as a home) to protect, and face particular difficulty in securing the legal help needed to navigate formal bankruptcy proceedings.Moreover, medical costs continue to outpace incomes, 29 million remain uninsured, and many of those with health insurance face unpredictable and unaffordable out-of-pocket costs as copayments and deductibles ratchet up. And few Americans have adequate disability coverage, leaving them vulnerable to illness-related income loss that amplifies the financial distress caused by medical bills.Rather than acting to make health care more affordable, the current administration seems intent on further hollowing out coverage: encouraging a migration to bare-bones, short-term insurance policies that leave enrollees largely unprotected; allowing states to impose Medicaid work requirements that threaten to swell the ranks of the uninsured; and joining a suit that would end enforcement of the ACA’s preexisting condition coverage mandate.The results of the midterm election—in which health care was the most prominent issue—stand as a rebuke to these retrograde steps. Instead, policymakers should move forward from the ACA and implement programs that guarantee coverage that is not just universal but also comprehensive, as well as sick leave and disability coverage that replaces income during illness.Although death is inevitable, good public policy can ensure that financial suffering from illness is not."

22,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7367538/,abstract,"Medical crowdfunding has emerged as a growing field for fundraising opportunities. Some environmental trends have driven the emergence of campaigns to raise funds for medical care. These trends include lack of medical insurance, economic backlash following the 2008 financial collapse, and shortcomings of health care regulations.Research regarding crowdfunding campaign use, reasons, and effects on the provision of medical care and individual relationships in health systems is limited. This study aimed to explore the nature and dimensions of the phenomenon of medical crowdfunding using a visual analytics approach and data crawled from the GoFundMe crowdfunding platform in 2019. We aimed to explore and identify the factors that contribute to a successful campaign.This data-driven study used a visual analytics approach. It focused on descriptive analytics to obtain a panoramic insight into medical projects funded through the GoFundMe crowdfunding platform.This study highlighted the relevance of positioning the campaign for fundraising. In terms of motivating donors, it appears that people are typically more generous in contributing to campaigns for children rather than those for adults. The results emphasized the differing dynamics that a picture posted in the campaign brings to the potential for medical crowdfunding. In terms of donor’s motivation, the results show that a picture depicting the pediatric patient by himself or herself is the most effective. In addition, a picture depicting the current medical condition of the patient as severe is more effective than one depicting relative normalcy in the condition. This study also drew attention to the optimum length of the title. Finally, an interesting trend in the trajectory of donations is that the average amount of a donation decreases with an increase in the number of donors. This indicates that the first donors tend to be the most generous.This study examines the relationship between social media, the characteristics of a campaign, and the potential for fundraising. Its analysis of medical crowdfunding campaigns across the states offers a window into the status of the country’s health care affordability. This study shows the nurturing role that social media can play in the domain of medical crowdfunding. In addition, it discusses the drivers of a successful fundraising campaign with respect to the GoFundMe platform."

25,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7275257/,abstract,"There are a range of perceived gaps and shortcomings in the publicly funded Canadian health system. These include wait times for care, lack of public insurance coverage for dental care and pharmaceuticals, and difficulties accessing specialist care. Medical crowdfunding is a response to these gaps where individuals raise funds from their social networks to address health-related needs.This study aimed to investigate the potential of crowdfunding data to better understand what health-related needs individuals are using crowdfunding for, how these needs compare with the existing commentary on health system deficiencies, and the advantages and limitations of using crowdfunding campaigns to enhance or augment our understanding of perceived health system deficiencies.Crowdfunding campaigns were scraped from the GoFundMe website. These campaigns were then limited to those originating in the metropolitan Vancouver region of two health authorities during 2018. These campaigns were then further limited to those raising funds to allow the treatment of a medical problem or related to needs arising from ill health. These campaigns were then reviewed to identify the underlying health issue and motivation for pursuing crowdfunding.We identified 423 campaigns for health-related needs. These campaigns requested CAD $8,715,806 (US $6,088,078) in funding and were pledged CAD $3,477,384 (US $2,428,987) from 27,773 donors. The most common underlying medical condition for campaign recipients was cancer, followed by traumatic injuries from collisions and brain injury and stroke. By far, the most common factor of motivation for crowdfunding was seeking financial support for wages lost because of illness (232/684, 33.9%). Some campaigns (65/684, 9.5%) sought help with purchasing medical equipment and supplies; 8.2% (56/684) sought to fund complementary, alternative, or unproven treatments including experimental interventions; 7.2% (49/684) sought financial support to cover travel-related costs, including in-province and out-of-province (49/684, 7.2%) travel; and 6.3% (43/684) campaigns sought help to pay for medication.This analysis demonstrates the potential of crowdfunding data to present timely and context-specific user-created insights into the perceived health-related financial needs of some Canadians. Although the literature on perceived limitations of the Canadian health system focuses on wait times for care and limited access to specialist services, among other issues, these campaigners were much more motivated by gaps in the wider social system such as costs related to unpaid time off work and travel to access care. Our findings demonstrate spatial differences in the underlying medical problems, motivations for crowdfunding, and success using crowdfunding that warrants additional attention. These differences may support established concerns that medical crowdfunding is most commonly used by individuals from relatively privileged socioeconomic backgrounds. We encourage the development of new resources to harness the power of crowdfunding data as a supplementary source of information for Canadian health system stakeholders."

28,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3273528/,abstract,"Forget about fundraising with signs and spaghetti dinners. When a friend or relative needs help paying medical bills, many Americans are turning their social network into a safety net through a growing number of online fundraising platforms.But some observers say these websites are a symptom of the failing health care system in the United States — and hardly a solution.Websites like Give Forward, Indie Go Go, GoFundMe and You Caring have been launched in the US over the past five years. Give Forward is the only site primarily focused on medical campaigns, and cofounder Ethan Austin says he’s seen people raise US$50 000 in a day.“This is such a gigantic need, we didn’t really anticipate how big it was,” he says.The concept is an extension of community fundraisers often held when people get sick. The websites help users connect their campaign to social media like Twitter and Facebook to solicit donations from family, friends and even strangers. It’s a kind of ‘crowdfunding’ — where many people chip in to fund a cause or project — that took off on sites like Kick Starter for entrepreneurs. Most crowdfunding sites take a percentage of the money raised by each campaign, usually between 3% and 7%.Since its launch in 2008, Give Forward campaigns have raised over US$8.8 million, and about 7600 campaigns have been completed, Austin says. Other fundraising sites accept campaigns for categories such as tuition, mission trips, start-ups or art projects. But at GoFundMe, the largest percentage of campaigns are health-related, and at You Caring the majority of donations are in the area of medical expenses, according to their founders.Austin says the popularity of these websites shows how desperate many Americans are when a relative or friend gets sick. “People don’t want to be seen as a charity case. But we’re all in the same boat, unless you’re Warren Buffett or Bill Gates or someone who’s mega-rich, we all could use a little extra help when someone gets sick.”With medical expenses the leading cause of personal bankruptcies in the United States, an increasing number of desperate Americans are turning to websites to raise money to pay for medical bills of relatives and friends.Medical expenses are the leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States, according to a study that indicated about 62% of personal bankruptcies in 2007 were reportedly due to medical bills, even though most of those people had insurance — up from about 46% in 2001 (Am J Med 2009; 122[8]:741–6).The average amount of money raised for a Give Forward health campaign is US$2650, though some have topped US$80 000.Ultimately, the growth of these websites is sad, but not surprising, given that simply tens of millions of Americans don’t have insurance, says Dr. Ida Hellander, director of health policy for the Physicians for a National Health Program, a nonprofit organization which advocates for universal health care.“I wouldn’t even say it’s a band-aid — it’s sort of a desperate attempt to help a few people,” she says. “It shows how desperate people are, and it shows the magnitude of the crisis and the fact that the political will is not there to help people.”Many Americans are driven to fundraise on the Internet because they do not have, or have inadequate, health insurance, she says. “It’s certainly no solution, and it’s probably not even a solution for the person raising the money — it just might help with this week’s bill.”Many of the campaigns on Give-Forward and other sites appear to be aimed at generating funds for an emergency, a specific treatment or recommended diagnostic tests. Rarely do they appear aimed at chronic illnesses or long-term care.The growth of crowdfunding sites points to the need for a broader cultural change in America than is possible through the use of crowdfunding, she adds. “It reflects the unethical and immoral health care system that pushes its citizens to have to essentially beg for money on the Internet.”Others are concerned about the impact Internet fundraising will have on the US health care system.It could slow progress toward a solution, says Rebecca Dresser, Daniel Noyes Kirby Professor and professor of ethics in medicine at the Washington University Law School in St. Louis, Missouri. “You might say to the extent it [a fundraising website] relieves the burden, it takes pressure off society and people in government to have a more effective health care system.”Crowdfunding sites should raise questions, like any decision about giving money, Dresser contends. True friends are different than Facebook friends, she points out, and you should trust that your money will go towards a real medical condition before donating. “If you’re trying to use your resources wisely, you should think about — what are alternative beneficiaries of my money? … Do I trust this person? I would want to find out — what is your medical situation? What has the doctor recommended?”There is always the possibility of abuse of Internet fundraising, as evidenced by the case of Ashley Kirilow of Burlington, Ontario, who in 2010 faked having cancer and used a Facebook page to help raise thousands of dollars.But Austin says there’s only been one case of fraud at Give Forward in the past three years, and the site holds donations in an escrow account until a campaign is over, so staff have time to investigate questionable Web pages and return monies to donors if necessary. Other websites forward monies to the recipient as soon as they’re raised but encourage users to identify and flag suspicious campaigns.Dresser suggests it might be more effective to donate that money to a registered charity or a nonprofit group that has a systematic way of distributing funds."

The case of Baby Pia, a Belgian girl with SMA type 1 for whom in 2018 more than $ 2.1 million was raised to get her treated with Zolgensma®, illustrates well the potential power of medical crowdfunding. But apart from the success in raising money, the case is also of particular importance for the ethical issues it brings to the surface as related to justice, equity, power imbalances, responsibility, accountability, indebtedness and privacy."

33,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9483272/,abstract,"Crowdfunding is emerging as an alternative form of funding for medical purposes, with capital being raised directly from a broader and more diverse audience of investors. In this paper, we have systematically researched and reviewed the literature on medical crowdfunding to determine how crowdfunding connects with the health care industry. The health care industry has been struggling to develop sustainable research and business models for economic systems and investors alike, especially in pharmaceuticals. The research results have revealed a wealth of evidence concerning the way crowdfunding is applied in real life. Patients and caregivers utilize web platform–based campaigns all over the world to fund their medical expenses, generally on a spot basis, using donation-based or even reward-based schemes, regardless of the health care system archetype (public, private insurance-based or hybrid). Academics have also focused on funding campaigns and the predictors of success (which range from social behaviour and environment to the basic demographics of the campaigners and their diseases) and on social and regulatory concerns, including heightened social inequality and stigma. While equity crowdfunding is disrupting the way many ventures/businesses seek capital in the market, our research indicates that there are no relevant or consistent data on the practice of medical equity crowdfunding in health care, apart from a few anecdotal cases."

Despite the popularity of medical crowdfunding, the current understanding of the success of medical crowdfunding campaigns is fragmented and inadequate.We aimed to comprehensively investigate which factors lead to the success of medical crowdfunding campaigns.A search was conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, ACM Digital Library, and ScienceDirect from 2010 to June 2020. Papers directly and indirectly related to the success of medical crowdfunding campaigns were included. Two reviewers independently extracted information on the success of medical crowdfunding campaigns.Our search yielded 441 articles, of which 13 met the inclusion criteria. Medical crowdfunding is increasingly attracting academic attention, and most studies leverage text analysis as their research methods; however, there is a lack of consensus on the definition of medical crowdfunding among researchers. Four categories of factors that affect the success of medical crowdfunding were identified: platforms, raisers, donors, and campaigns.Although some limitations exist in our systematic review, our study captured and mapped literatures of the success of medical crowdfunding campaigns systematically, which can be used as the basis for future research on this topic."

We used a cross-sectional design to analyze data retrieved from the 2014 Health Center Patient Survey. Adult participants who self-reported having type 2 diabetes were included in this study. Predictor variables were categorized into personal, financial, and structural barriers. Outcomes include being unable to get and delayed in getting prescription medications. Chi-square and multivariable regression models were conducted to examine associations between predictor and outcome variables. A total of 1097 participants with type 2 diabetes were included in analyses. Approximately 29% of participants were delayed, and 24% were unable to get medications. Multivariable regression results showed that personal barriers, such as federal poverty level, health status, and psychological distress were associated with being unable to get medications. Financial barriers including out-of-pocket medication cost and employment were associated with access to prescription medications. Type of health center funding program as a structural barrier was associated with access to medications. In conclusion, multi-level tailored strategies and policy changes are needed to address these barriers to improve access to prescription medications and health outcomes in underserved patient populations."

44,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10391227/,abstract,"It is well known that medication accessibility reduces morbidity and mortality and increases health-related quality of life; however, despite efforts to improve health care access, many Americans still face challenges in accessing medications. Several health care access and utilization conceptual frameworks have been created and used for decades to illustrate key relationships and interdependencies between elements of the system. However, none of these frameworks have focused exclusively on medication access and associated factors. Medication access is a complex, multidimensional issue that must consider not only patient-specific challenges, but also health system limitations, among others. A better understanding of medication access, beyond the proxy marker of adherence, is needed to identify opportunities to improve accessibility.To develop a conceptual framework that defines a patient’s medication access journey and characterizes barriers frequently encountered while seeking medication access.A multistakeholder roundtable composed of 15 experts from across the health care continuum was convened in 2018 by the Pharmacy Quality Alliance to develop a conceptual framework for medication access. The roundtable participants were convened through in-person and telephonic meetings. To inform their work, 2 literature reviews and an environmental scan were conducted to identify medication access barriers, interventions affecting medication access, and medication access quality measures.The resulting framework included 7 nodes that represent the major access points encountered by patients when attempting to access medications: perceived need, help seeking, encounter, prescribing, prescription adjudication, prescription dispensing, and adherence. Also, 18 barriers were identified. Patient health literacy, cost, insurance, and organizational health literacy were predominant barriers across multiple nodes.The framework that was developed provides a patient-focused, holistic view of medication access, incorporating access nodes and corresponding barriers. It also provides a structure to consider key opportunities for interventions and measurement to address medication access challenges."

46,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10637357/,abstract,"Reddit’s (Reddit Inc) large user base, diverse communities, and anonymity make it a useful platform for substance use research. Despite a growing body of literature on substance use on Reddit, challenges and limitations must be carefully considered. However, no systematic scoping review has been conducted on the use of Reddit as a data source for substance use research.This review aims to investigate the use of Reddit for studying substance use by examining previous studies’ objectives, reasons, limitations, and methods for using Reddit. In addition, we discuss the implications and contributions of previous studies and identify gaps in the literature that require further attention.A total of 7 databases were searched using keyword combinations including Reddit and substance-related keywords in April 2022. The initial search resulted in 456 articles, and 227 articles remained after removing duplicates. All included studies were peer reviewed, empirical, available in full text, and pertinent to Reddit and substance use, and they were all written in English. After screening, 60 articles met the eligibility criteria for the review, with 57 articles identified from the initial database search and 3 from the ancestry search. A codebook was developed, and qualitative content analysis was performed to extract relevant evidence related to the research questions.The use of Reddit for studying substance use has grown steadily since 2015, with a sharp increase in 2021. The primary objective was to identify tendencies and patterns in various types of substance use discussions (52/60, 87%). Reddit was also used to explore unique user experiences, propose methodologies, investigate user interactions, and develop interventions. A total of 9 reasons for using Reddit to study substance use were identified, such as the platform’s anonymity, its widespread popularity, and the explicit topics of subreddits. However, 7 limitations were noted, including the platform’s low representativeness of the general population with substance use and the lack of demographic information. Most studies use application programming interfaces for data collection and quantitative approaches for analysis, with few using qualitative approaches. Machine learning algorithms are commonly used for natural language processing tasks. The theoretical, methodological, and practical implications and contributions of the included articles are summarized and discussed. The most prevalent practical implications are investigating prevailing topics in Reddit discussions, providing recommendations for clinical practices and policies, and comparing Reddit discussions on substance use across various sources.This systematic scoping review provides an overview of Reddit’s use as a data source for substance use research. Although the limitations of Reddit data must be considered, analyzing them can be useful for understanding patterns and user experiences related to substance use. Our review also highlights gaps in the literature and suggests avenues for future research."

49,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8824724/,abstract,"Among individuals with low income, medication cost is a well-established barrier to medication adherence. Spending less on basic needs to pay for medication is a particularly concerning cost-coping strategy and may be associated with worse health outcomes. The aims of this study were (1) to describe the demographic and health status characteristics of those who report spending less on basic needs to pay for medication, and (2) to understand the associated psychosocial and financial challenges of individuals who make these choices.We administered a survey to primarily low-income adults (n=270) in St. Louis, Missouri as part of a larger study from 2016–2018. Logistic regression was used to model the odds of reporting spending less on basic needs in order to pay for medication.Spending less on basic needs to pay for medication was significantly more likely in individuals with fair or poor health status (OR = 2.00; 95% CI, 1.03 to 3.93), greater number of chronic conditions (OR = 1.21 per additional 1 condition, 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.40), greater medication expenditure (OR = 1.41 per additional $100; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.89), and difficulty paying bills (OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.85). Individuals who spent less on basic needs were less likely to be fully adherent to their medication regimen (OR = 0.38; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.77).Screening for unmet basic needs and offering referrals to social safety net programs in the primary care setting may help patients achieve sustainable medication adherence."

We used 3 rounds of qualitative coding to identify themes.Providers lacked access to information about: patients’ ability to pay for medications; true costs of full medication regimens; and cost impacts of patient insurance changes. Some providers said that while existing cost-related tools were helpful, they contained unclear insurance information and several questioned the information’s quality. Cost-related information was not available to everyone who needed it and was not always available when needed. Fragmentation of information across sources made cost-alleviation information difficult to access. Providers desired future tools to compare medication costs more directly; provide quick references on costs to facilitate clinical conversations; streamline medication resource referrals; and provide centrally accessible visual summaries of patient affordability challenges.These findings can inform the next generation of informatics tools for minimizing patients’ out-of-pocket costs. Future tools should support the work of a wider range of providers and situations and use cases than current tools do. Such tools would have the potential to improve prescribing decisions and better link patients to resources.Results identified opportunities to fill multidisciplinary providers’ information gaps and ways in which new tools could better support medication affordability for patients."

Use of medicines forms a large part of healthcare facility. As the number of medicines and brands are ever increasing in today’s market, it is usual for pharmacy to substitute a generic instead of the prescribed brand or a different brand if the prescribed brand is not available. Depending on the type of substitute, it could fall under ‘generic’ or ‘therapeutic’ substitution. For any condition, there may be numerous medicines existing, some of which probably got introduced more recently, may be more expensive and erroneously perceived to act better than the earlier known medications for the same ailment. Also, due to very high number of medicines that are approved and available for use in the market, it is impossible to stock all the medicines in any pharmacy. Generic and therapeutic substitutions should be formalised and implemented by institutions, with the consent and cooperation of all the stake holders as guided by World Health Organisation. The advantages and limitations of medicine substitutes are discussed in the review."

57,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8169601/,abstract,"Pharmaceuticals are priced uniformly by convention, but vary in their degree of effectiveness for different disease indications. As more high-cost therapies have launched, the demand for alternative payment models (APMs) has been increasing in many advanced markets, despite their well-documented limitations and challenges to implementation. Among policy justifications for such contracts is the maximization of value given scarce resources. We show that while uniform pricing rules can handle variable effectiveness in efficient markets, market inefficiencies of other kinds create a role for different value-based pricing structures. We first present a stylized theoretical model of efficient interaction among drug manufacturers, payers, and beneficiaries. In this stylized setting, uniform pricing works well, even when treatment effects are variable. We then use this framework to define market failures that result in obstacles to uniform pricing. The market failures we identify include: (1) uncertainty of patient distribution, (2) asymmetric beliefs, (3) agency imperfection by payer, (4) agency imperfection by provider, and (5) patient behavior and treatment adherence. We then apply our insights to real-world examples of alternative payment models, and highlight challenges related to contract implementation."
