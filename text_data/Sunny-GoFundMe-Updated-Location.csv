Help with medical bills and insulin drug costs,"$8,005 raised of $7,000 goal","What a time to be alive, amirite?
I recently found out that my insurance company is not covering ANY of my diabetic insulin medications or doctor visits until I pay out of pocket towards a $5,000 deductible and I am forced to pay out of pocket for my life saving drugs. This company did this without telling me and gave me no time to get different insurance before this happened. I am in need of serious help to pay for medication and my doctor. After spending a week without medication and trying to get my insurance company, state Rep and the pharmaceutical companies to help me I have been denied any help. This is all happening at the same time I am trying to move and find housing, I am reaching out to my community at this time to try and help. Please if you can spare anything it would mean a lot. Our country is in shambles and the health care system is yet again failing the people it’s supposed to support.

Thank you got reading this far and for any help or support you can offer. ❤️","New York, NY"
Kym Walker - help with paying for cancer treatment,"$11,130 AUD raised","Hi, my name is Claire and I am Kym's bestie and neighbour. Kym runs Soma-Kai Pilates and Karate in Lara. Kym was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer in 2021 and has been undergoing treatment ever since. She has exhausted all treatment available under the PBS so is currently paying for very new ground breaking chemo drugs. Kym has already paid $24,000 for one type of new chemo drug that unfortunately did not work. The treatment that she is currently receiving costs $10,000 every 3 weeks and Kym has paid for 3 of those treatments so far. It is capped at $50,000 after which she will continue to receive the treatment. I am putting the call out to see if we can raise some funds to help her with one of those treatments.",Lara VIC
Help Adam With Drug Rehab,"$16,814 raised of $18,000 goal","Dear Friends,

We are writing to you to try to help an old friend from Sharon/Syracuse, Adam Gleken. As many of you may know Adam has been battling drug and an alcohol addiction. He is now basically homeless and in a dire and physically dangerous situation as he was living on the streets in Bonita Springs, Florida.

We have had an opportunity to talk to Adam over the last few weeks trying to help him get out of this situation and got him into a halfway house in West Palm Beach as an interim step.

The next step is for Adam to enter a drug rehabilitation program that will enable him to address the very difficult challenges that have placed him in this situation.

To that end, we have decided to send Adam to a highly respected program on the West Coast of Florida which has the highest success rate for a Drug Free Withdrawal program. They are very reputable and qualified in dealing with an individual that are stuck in the grip of addiction. This is generally a 3-6 month program and part of the graduating requirements are that he has a job and a place to live and they will continue to support him as he gets set up to do well in life.

The full cost of the program is $30,000. We have gotten a scholarship approved to help with the financial cost. We were able to arrange a significant discount and bring this down to $18,000. Additionally, they have agreed to allow Adam to start with $10,000 and work off the rest at the end of the program. Funds donated to this cause are tax deductible. This will provide all of his room and board and program services and individual counseling that Adam will need.

We would greatly appreciate if you would join us in raising the funding necessary to help Adam and to ensure the resources are there for him to start this program; one that is likely to be the difference between a life on the streets or one where he can lay the foundation for living a clean life and more hopeful future.

Though many of you have not seen or spoken to Adam for some time, we are sure you can remember some good qualities of Adam in the past and we are trying to get that Adam back, that we once knew and cared for.

Given the circumstances and what the consequences may be if we don't help; we are turning to all of you who know Adam and would be willing to provide support and assistance.

If we are not able to raise the full amount to get Adam into the rehabilitation program, the funds will go towards assisting Adam with his living expenses and get him established in the halfway house.

The funds will be managed by us.

Kind Regards,

Jon Katz, Jack Berkowitz, Barry Fienberg & Jon Saphire

Help Gabby Focus on RECOVERY post Cardiac Arrest.,"$20,523 CAD raised of $20,000 goal","Gabby Ho, Our happy, personable, passionate, optimistic cousin requires our immediate help. We need to raise a minimum of $10,000 to offset the financial stress that Gabby, my aunt and uncle will endure while Gabby recovers from cardiac arrest due to anaphylactic shock. She will suffer permanent brain damage due to gross negligence from someone not following simple instructions at a Tim Hortons in Winnipeg. To add insult to injury, she was met with a drug-induced anaphylactic reaction in the hospital. The medication that was ordered failed to be recognized as an allergen by the Doctor, the Pharmacist and the Nurse who administered it. Our cousin not only suffered ONCE but TWICE! We have no idea how long Gabby will be in the hospital to allow her brain to recover and relearn basic motor skills. Considering the secondary reaction was in the hospital, my aunt has a hard time leaving my cousin's side. She wants to be there to make sure this does not happen again. Our family is heartbroken at what Gabby has endured. We are hoping to raise as much as we can to help pay Gabby’s bills and recover wage loss. The extra money that is raised will go towards the legal costs she will face when she sues for negligence. We're setting incremental goals of $2,000, and we're determined to reach our first milestone promptly. Let's rally together to help keep Gabby focused on her precious time to recover, and to have her mom and dad at her side without financial stress.


 Hi, my name is Erin, and I have my sister Miranda assisting me, with this Go Fund Me for our younger cousin Gabby. Gabby suffered an injury that was life-altering and strong enough to change her life forever. What happened? read below for detail. Gabby has always had a severe allergy to dairy products. I can remember my aunty reading every label on everything, right down to the fine print to make sure my cousin would avoid an allergic reaction. To put things into perspective how severe her allergy is, one day my mom had some chips that contained lactose (she didn’t know at the time). She finished eating those chips and wiped her hands clean on a napkin then just simply touched Gabby to say hello, and within seconds Gabby had full body hives and swelling.


On June 9th, 2023, Gabby would experience a life-altering event that her mother so carefully prevented in Gabby’s child/teen years. But alas, Gabby is now an adult and is out and about in the world. At just 25 years old she loves life, loves friends, and loves being independent. On the day in question, Gabby ordered a tea from the Tim Hortons online app and specifically stated ""Almond milk"". She happily walked to the “Timmies” to pick up her order, just as she always does on her break at work. When she took a sip she instantly knew that they had messed up her order. They had put cream instead of Almond milk. She called her mom instantly a panic as her body started to react telling her what had happened. Her mom advised her to use her epi-pen, which she did. But Gabby knew it wouldn’t be enough, and she told her mom the same. Gabby then used her Epi-pen and her co-worker rushed her to the hospital via car. An ambulance would have taken too long to wait for. Her co-worker arrived at the emergency doors just as Gabby started to go into Cardiac Arrest. Emergency staff performed 8 minutes of cardiac resuscitation and finally got Gabby’s pulse back. Gabby was then sent to the MICU where she was sedated and hooked up to multiple machines to help her body rest after the traumatic event. My aunt was told that it was very likely that Gabby will have an anoxic brain injury. As to the extent, they did not know. My aunt, Uncle and Gabby’s siblings waited patiently for Gabby to regain consciousness. When that time came, Gabby was very emotional to learn that she had died. Her coordination is not as it used to be. She became frustrated when she would try to use her phone or do other simple things that required coordination. Days later Gabby was assisted with exercises the physiotherapist had set for her. She was able to stand assisted on both sides and pick up both legs although with great difficulty, to a 90-degree angle. She was able to slowly step forward and backwards but with very poor motor movement. This was upsetting, but she didn’t give up too easily. She was able to slowly walk with 2 persons assisting at each side. Things were looking up for our family. She was working on her motor skills and was finally smiling again. That was until her EEG results showed that her brain was having constant seizures. This news was painful for our family to hear because we knew it wasn’t good news for her recovery or future and could lead to further brain injury. The doctors were not expecting this at all. So they ordered her some medication to stop the seizures. The doctor ordered a medication that just happened to have lactose in it. The doctor failed to check if this medication had lactose!! It was also missed by the pharmacist and the nurse! 3 STEPS of missed checks could have prevented what had happened next. My cousin suffered another anaphylactic reaction. This time thankfully in the hospital where they addressed it ASAP. She did not go into cardiac arrest during this event. However Gabby is emotionally, physically, and mentally exhausted. It is unknown how long she will be in the hospital to recover. As a young adult, she has bills to pay. As well as my aunt and uncle who are also missing a great amount of work to be there at their daughter’s side to support her. I want to minimize the financial stress on them as this is not something they need in the background when their focus should be on Gabby's recovery. We still do not know the extent of her brain injuries. So any donation/share would be appreciated to offset the financial strain on them during this hard time. If we raise enough, the extra money will go towards legal fees when she is ready and capable of suing for gross negligence. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for helping in any way you can. We Love all the support we can get. Even if it's ""air hugs"" or well wishes. Thank you for your time. Sincerely, Erin and Miranda on behalf of our baby cousin Gabby!


EDIT: WOW! So amazing! We exceeded the $10,000 I wasn’t expecting this much love. Thank you to everyone who donated or gave a well wish or a share, our hearts are so full. I changed the goal to $20,000. Let’s see if we can get her close to that amount! That would 100% take the stress off of her and her immediate family as well as be enough to pay a retainer for the lawyer as well as ensure she is set up for any medical expenses she will need once discharged from the hospital to improve her quality of life. We LOVE you All!

Drug Addiction,"$1,600 raised of $9,000 goal","Hi my name is Pat and I am fundraising for my daughter who is in a Rehab Center. Parents of addicts have a whole separate layer to their own story. It is about Hope and not giving up but mostly sadness and pain. It is a very lonely place to be. But I am reaching out to friends and family and my community to tell them that one person that I know is asking for help and is asking for change. As some of you may know true support for an addict is very hard to come by. It's not as easy as many may think. If we can all come together and try to save one life that would be fantastic. My daughter is in a place that has the right support and approach to overcome her physical and mental challenges. Her journey is not over. Did you know that most insurances cover only 20 to 30 days in house treatment? The time needed to recover from addiction can be different for everyone. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) recommends that people spend AT LEAST 90 DAYS in an addiction recovery program. I am asking for help to continue for 2 more months. All funds received will pay
for these next 2 months. Any additional funds if any will be donated to the Center Resilience","Willsboro, NY"
Help sister with drug rehab !,"$6,000 raised of $6,000 goal","      For quite some time our family has been trying to get my younger sister into a drug rehab. Due to her drug use, within the last year she has been hospitalized many times with life threatening infections. The pain this kind of addiction can bring to ones family is overwhelming to say the least.

      Not to long ago I had to tell her, ""we are done, when you are ready, let us know and we will do what we can to help you get yourself the help you need!"" This was one of the harder thing I've had to do in my life but I know she has to want to get help she needs.

      Thankfully, shortly after my ultimadum, SHE GOT HERSELF into an all woman's drug rehab. Where she is now in a safe place and can start working toward her road to recovery.

      In order to secure her a bed in the recovery center are family needs to raise $6,000.  Among our family we were able raise $3,800. Leaving a remaining total of $2,000. With the help of our community and gofundme, we now only still need to raise about $1,000.

      I am a student working toward a degree in Nursing. This fall I will be applying at the Maurine Church Coburn School of Nursing at Monterey Peninsula College. Right now is when I am wishing I was already a nurse because I know once I reach my goal I will be able help my family and give back to my community. Today I am asking for your help.

      My sister has two beautiful children, a 19 year old young woman and a 10 year old son, whom thankfully my mother has been taking care of. My deepest wish is for my sister to be able to share in the lives of her children and of her family who love her.


        As I shared our struggle with friends everyone is said the same thing ""try gofundme."" I had never heard of gofundme before but now I am so grateful for the suport I have gotten. I could not have done it on my own.
 
      Please donate or help me pass the word on.Every little bit helps. Thank You for taking the time here. Please join me in praying for strength and courage for my sister and her path to recovery.

Medical financial assistance needed,"$2,530 raised of $8,000 goal","We live in western Michigan, in our 70's, and our medical bills are overwhelming. We both suffer multiple health problems. Our names are Roger and Sandy. Roger has cancer and is being treated with Lenvima, which is a type of chemo treatment. We have just been notified the hospital will assist him with the statements for this year. The price per treatment is $3200, which the pharmaceutical company provides without charge, for which we are very thankful. However, we still are paying on past billings, doctor bills, and prescriptions for which we had to use credit cards. But Roger also has diabetes and muscular dystrophy. Sandy has recently had back and hands surgery and has high cholesterol, vascular disease, high blood pressure, hypertension, and macular degeneration. Sandy has to get injections every 5 to 6 weeks into both eyes and pays the doctor to perform the injections $350 every time. Fortunately, the manufacturer pays for the injection drug. Sandy has trouble buying medicine and paying for tests and doctor visits, often going without treatment because of a lack of finances. She gets just over 700 dollars from Social security, and her medicare and supplement insurance has to come out of that. We both worked hard all of our lives, working multiple jobs. Roger had a cleaning business and worked hard at a woodworking shop for many years. Later, he started remodeling and restoring furniture and cabinets. His work was beautiful and highly praised; he never charged enough. Sandy also had various jobs; she cleaned buildings and was a store clerk. Then she started at a plant that eventually moved out of Michigan. Sandy then got a few jobs that paid minimum wages. She ultimately got a very satisfying job working with children with special needs at a public school. The school provided health insurance, but they decided to cut Sandy's hours which was detrimental to the children and her to lose health insurance. Now that we are in our 70s receiving federally funded health care, we still find it is not enough to pay for current and past medical expenses. We never thought we'd be in this position. Sandy told Roger, ""if one of us dies, the other could receive the benefits we need right now."" No one should wish to die under such instances! We hope and pray we can get the assistance we need to have a lovely rest of our lives together. Living without this pressure would help us much; pray soon this will happen. Thank you for reading our story.

Paying for Nausea Relief Medication,"$3,625 raised of $1,500 goal","Aloha friends and family,
  This request is very humbling. I unfortunately found out today that my health insurance was changed without me knowing just prior to my divorce to a HMSA Quest plan that is the very lowest and has no drug plan attached to it ( practically a plan the homeless people for a mere $35 a month) . Although my divorce decree stated my Heath insurance should be paid by my ex husband for only three years and it should be the same ( I’ve always held gold PPO Blue Cross insurance) my ex secretly switch me to a solo plan costing him only $35/ month. This plan will not pay for my nausea medications which are $600/ month. In November I will enroll in my usual health insurance coverage but that won’t activate til Jan. 2022! So the goal here is to help me pay for the drugs needed to counteract the chemo symptoms. Yes I’m in shock! Yes I feel undeserving of this blindsided move, and I’m extremely humbled to put this forward. But vulnerability is strength and with 6 months chemo my strength is not at its top potential. Thank you if you can help. If funds are tight for you I would not want to receive more than a smile and encouraging word. Aloha","Kahului, HI"

Help get our Mum the cancer treatment she needs,"£26,615 raised of £35,000 goal","Dear friends, we are starting this fundraiser to collect funds to pay for the treatment costs of our Mum, Julie, who has stage 4 metastatic lung cancer and has exhausted all treatment options.

A few days after Christmas in 2020 our mum noticed a small blur in her vision. Thinking it was probably nothing to fear, she visited her optometrist who expected that she had a detached retina, a very common and trivial-to-treat condition.
Following a series of long and stressful tests our Mum, a non-smoking, otherwise healthy and active 54-year-old was diagnosed with late-stage HER2-positive lung cancer. As anyone reading this will imagine, this was a devastating shock to the whole family. Not just how out of the blue the diagnosis was, but the stage at which this disease presented itself, with no prior warning or symptoms.

Help a Caregiver & Teacher w Medication Expense,"$2,555 raised of $2,175 goal","See the little girl on the left in the picture? That is me, not long before I was diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis at age 3. Those aren't knobby knees, they are painfully swollen knees. Medication changed my life and allowed me to do whatever I wanted to do!

About 20 years ago, I started a new injectable medication for arthritis which comes from a specialty company. It has been amazing for me. I was able to stop ALL other arthritis medication except for at times, ibuprofen and Aleve. The copay had been low for me, $30-50 a month. Insurance covered the rest of the $7,000 per month cost (yes, I am serious).

While I was supporting my mom as her husband was hospitalized and went into hospice in June and July, that all changed. My employer and insurance provider changed how they cover specialty medication. I did get two voice mails while I was bringing mom back and forth to the hospital, nursing home and hospital but I didn't get to return the messages (they were probably to tell me of the change ).

I am running out of options here. My mother has had a very long fight with mental health and drug abuse. From what I can remember it started when I was about 18-19. Probably before due to me being homeless on and off trying to graduate. Mental illness is very bad and as I tried to break away from toxicity it followed me and/or I allowed it because it was my mother and I wanted a mother. She have lived with me (starting at 38) in many apartments throughout out the years. I am a single mother of 2 kids and it has been very hard on me. No family wants to help when someone struggled with drug abuse. My mother has been very close to death on many occasions even found laying downtown for 4 days before going to the hospital. I came and saved her because of my heart. However I am now 31 and I can’t carry that weight any more of my mother. She was bless with her own apartment in Austin but now her health is too bad and doctors have declared her fully disabled and can’t live alone. They have a shortage of caretakers in Austin so they was only sending a caretaker once a week and eventually it stopped. My mom was discovered by nurses on the floor full of feces. This is very hard for me to type this and although I can’t do much anymore. Insurance that I pay for is not fully covering her skilled nursing stay. The hospital is ready to discharge her but I don’t have enough money to pay for 2 months in the nursing home. While I create a plan to get her voucher moved to Houston to possibly set up caretakers to help her here. We are waiting on an appeal to clear for SSI, being my mom is only 51 we have faced a lot of denials. I am asking the public anything helps to get her set up for a couple months until me and the lawyers figure out the rest. Once SSI clears she can stay in nursing home long term.

Help With Co Pay and Medical Bills,"$1,835 raised of $1,000 goal","Hi. My name is Jimi and I’m reaching out for help with my medical copays. I am a 66-year-old widow who was diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma in 2017 and have been fighting cancer ever since. I had chemotherapy for 2 years and then received a bone marrow transplant in early March 2023. I just found out that I am very close to remission however I will need to stay on a maintenance chemotherapy drug to reach/stay in remission. I do have Medicare however unfortunately I just hit my Part D gap (doughnut hole) coverage, meaning nothing is covered until I hit my max out-of-pocket cost.
The chemo maintenance medication will cost $2300/month. I also have another medication that I need for my health which costs $500/month. In addition to a few other medications I need to continue to take, however, are only around a few hundred/month. My doctor has applied for a grant for my chemotherapy drug, however, I need to start it right away and the doctor said it will be a few months before I might get the grant. If I do get the grant they would pay for the chemo medication moving forward as it is not retroactive. Therefore I need to start paying the $2300/month for that medication immediately. There are no grants available for my other medication of $500/month, unfortunately. Together these 2 medications will total $2800/month which is way over my income.

Support: IV Therapy Medical Treatment Assistance,"$836 raised of $5,000 goal","Hi my name is Brian but I go by my middle name, Julius, I’m 37 years old and I could really use help with paying for my monthly health insurance. Right now I am paying $617 monthly out of pocket to keep coverage. I have UC, Ulcerative Colitis, an autoimmune medical condition with no cure. The good part is I am currently in remission and have no issues at all, but the problem is I need to receive IV therapy every 8 weeks with a powerful drug called Entyvio to keep my condition under control. The drug itself is very expensive and costs $19,500.00 per dose. However- since I have insurance, the drug company assists me with a rebate that keeps the costs low at $5. So really my main priority is to keep coverage to maintain myself and to continue receiving treatment. I cannot lose my medical insurance. I had a difficult transition back in February and had to change jobs. So from February to April I was jobless and doing Uber Eats until I found an opportunity. Thankfully I was blessed and found a new job that started in April. I had to take a sacrifice and a pay cut but it was my best and only opportunity I could’ve taken for my scenario in my area. Since then I’ve been juggling my bills trying to get by but it’s just too much for me with late bills and current bills piling up and I can’t get out of this hole. I plan on asking my new job owner for help and assistance but I can’t just rely on him and I don’t want to lose my job it’s such a great place and an opportunity of a lifetime. I could really use help with paying for my medical insurance it would help me out so much. I don’t know where else to go or who to get help from. My credit score is low and the banks won’t help me. I live alone with my dog and I live in New York, my family lives in California. What I am asking for is $5000 to help me get ahead to pay 6 months of medical insurance, which covers me up to December, ($3085), and the leftover $1915 to help me pay for my late bills that have piled up like, electricity, a red light ticket and misc things like food for my dog and food for myself. Anything would help me so much, I’m the Executive Sous Chef at a new popular restaurant that just opened here in town. I’m very happy and I can’t just quit this all and lose everything that I’ve worked for to get at this level. The last thing I want to do is give up and move back to California and get a job at some random place I hate just to have insurance. Thank you for understanding and taking the time to read this. I appreciate your help and support. ￼￼￼￼

Paying For Life Changing Medicine,$340 raised of $740 goal,"Hey Everyone - This is Jesse, and I'm the husband of Te. Te was diagnosed with CADASIL, which is a genetic disorder that affects the blood vessels in her brain to be smaller than the average human. This leads to debilitating migraines that look like strokes.

Finding what can help ease the pain has been an ongoing struggle. Finally, after years, we found a shot that has basically all but eliminated all signs and symptoms. The issue is that we don’t have private insurance or RX to cover the cost of the shot. We have Medi-Cal, but only their neurologist can prescribe this shoot, and we’ve been waiting months to get in and can’t see that doctor till October, and we don’t even know if they will prescribe this life-altering medication.

We only know this works because the primary doctor (outside the Medi-Cal system) that she goes to has graciously given her 3 shots. We will now have to pay the cost till November. That’s when we can get Kaiser.

Each shot costs $740, and needs to be self-administered once a month. We are working with our non-Medi-Cal doc to work with the drug maker to get us qualified to get a grant to pay, but who knows when that will happen.

We knew this would happen and have been saving, but it still stinks not to get the care Te needs due to healthcare insecurity. Thanks for hearing part of our story, and thanks for supporting The Adams Family.

Help with Aaron's Recovery,"$1,265 raised of $45,000 goal","Hi, my name is Aaron and I'm 33 years old. I would appreciate your help in receiving the treatment I need to counteract the bad side affects that happened from taking an antibiotic in early November 2023 prescribed by an urologist. I started having side affects as I was finishing the prescription, and only found out afterward that the drug I took was a black box, toxic drug (why it's allowed to continue to be prescribed is beyond me). Unfortunately, the side affects do not wear off with time, and actually continue to do damage to my tendons and joints. My blood work has shown the degenerative tendencies from the drug, and evidence of other conditions that were not present before taking this drug. If I can receive treatment soon, it could hopefully help to reverse the affects. After much research and many doctors' visits, medical professionals have let me know of such a treatment for side affects from this specific drug, and it is located in Los Angeles, CA. Since I live in Virginia, the cost of travel, lodging and board are being included in my request. The rest is to pay for this specific treatment:

WELLs fight against Drug ADDICTion,"$2,555 raised of $3,000 goal","Nick is my 21 year old son who has struggled over the past few years with addiction.  I have watched Nick struggle.  His story began in high school.  I had never known this, but he did start with alcohol and marijuana, over the counter pain medications and after he had graduated went to North Dakota where he became involved with Crystal Meth.  This has been a horrific ride, but it never used to be like this.
Nick was a star athlete in wrestling and soccer.  He had so many friends in high school, a supportive family.  He has a sister who is just about 16 years old.  She is a bright star, driven young woman.  He has a brother who is 18 years old, just graduated from high school and now is working and spending time hunting, that seems to be his passion.  Nick in our view has had everything he ever wanted in life, but a part of him has been in pain.  We do not understand why he started to use drugs, we may never understand it. 
His story is far from over, he has many lives to touch.  You see he has hit rock bottom a few times, has been in jail, is on probation, and now is in a sort of half way home.  He is in wait for a spot in Good Samaritan Rehabilitation.  This will cost 2,500 dollars to enter into a two month program.  After the two month time frame is complete he will then be moved to a home with in the ranch and get a job for another 9 months or so, he will be expected to pay 300 dollars a month for the home and will be expected to follow protocol at the ranch.  He will then have a job and will be able to pay his fees. 
At this time, this family does not have the funds to pay for Nick to go to this program.  They do not take insurance currently.  I have heard and researched this program, Nick has a strong relationship with Jesus and reads the bible every day.  This truly is the best place for him at this time of his life.  We are hopeful for his healing.  He does not have a choice at this time, if he does not seek help and is a part of this recovery he will be sent to prison in South Dakota or he will end up back on the streets.  You see when he came to my home-he was homeless, he had been injecting the drugs at this time and living in his car.  He had not eaten in days, it was terrifying to see my son in such a state.  I want to help him and I would love any donation to help him get to the ranch.  I am able to put some money aside along with his grandpa, but it is not enough to get him in.  For now, he is safe.  My son is a lost soul, but I believe this will help him.  I have developed a FB site to support and update everyone on him while teaching the world about the reality of addiction. 
()
I have also taken classes on Meth awareness and am currently a member with the state of Idaho (Idaho Meth Project)
I am terified for my son, the world can not lose him to drugs and something horrible is going to happen if he ends up back on the streets with the people he has been with.  I am trying to save my sons life, but make no mistake, I know he has to be the one to save himself.  He has to make that choice to create his own furture and get away from the people and drugs that bring him down.  He has to let that life go and it has to be his decision.  Right now, he knows this and he is struggling every day to make it happen.  It is hard, he can easily walk away from the half way home, but he is fighting so hard to get into the ranch.  He is fighting to get help, I ask you to help us fight.   Even if it is a small donation, we are not a family that asks for anything...we just do not know any other way to get him what he needs.  I also know and understand, this may not be his first time going to rehab of some sort...but it has to start somewhere. 
Sadly my son feels no one cares for him, part of addiction.  I want to show him, we as a community of friends and family do care and we will help him fight...in return he has to fight and he has to show all of us he can do this.  That is the expectation I have of him, he must see we all stand behind him.  Even if it is small amounts, anything helps.

This is the sight for the place he will be going to--his probation officer is helping and the team does have him in a home currently.  We need to get him in the ranch with in the next month if we can.  We are looking for help.  I know many know Nick, please help him in this time of need.  Thank you!

I am asking for 3,000 dollars to help pay for his first month of 300 and food once he is done at the ranch.  This will be regulated through myself or the Pastor.  Currently the home he is living in is on donation only as well, we are buying food for him and the men that are there and will give what ever is remaining to the charity of this half way home.  Thank you so much for your help.

Haven House Medication Fund,$510 raised of $500 goal,"Hi! My name is Simone and I am a social work student at the University of Mississippi. I am seeking donations to help clients at Haven House cover the cost of their medications.

Rehab and recovery treatment,"£539 raised of £10,000 goal","Hello,
I’m Naomi, I’m 20 years old and have been struggling and battling with drug misuse and mental health for about 5 years now. It has gotten to a point where it has begun to damage all areas of my life and affect my health, and I finally have accepted and realised that I need help. I have chosen to go to private rehab centre to get the help I need. I have gone private as I am aware that I need the help and support as quickly as I can. And the nhs centres have an extremely long waiting list and I personally do not agree with how they treat or look after their patients. However as it is private centre, we are having to pay over 6,000 a month for me to be able to go and stay. Unfortunately I do not have that money available to me and my family are able to help but it sadly does not cover all the costs. I’ve created this Gofundme to see if anyone would be willing or able to help to some money towards paying for my travel and stay while at rehab. Any amount no matter how small is so greatly appreciated. I’ll be admitted on the 9th of April. I want to assure you and put your mind at ease that this money will not be going or handled by me and will be going straight to the centre, so the money donated will not be misused by me but only used towards helping me.",
Rosie’s Relief Fund,"$16,950 raised of $15,000 goal","As some of you may know my mom was diagnosed with leukemia in early 2021.

She applies every year for financial assistance directly from the pharmaceutical company that makes her chemo drug. The price of her daily medication, needed to stay alive, with insurance is $3000 per month and due to some inane change in the finer details of insurance coverage, which I’ve yet to understand, we’ve received notice that she is being denied financial assistance.

Son's funeral expenses,"$1,590 raised of $10,000 goal","On May 28th, 2009, my first-born son Jordan passed away from a very short battle with drug addiction. Our lives changed forever that day. He is dearly missed by his three younger sisters and brother, his parents and grandparents.

Jordan was just finishing high school, was a star high school wrestler and well loved by everyone he knew. He was a wonderful and caring person who was introduced to heroin about 6 months before his death. The drug and disease took control of his life overnight. With the help and dedication of his family, Jordan worked hard to turn his life around. He completed drug rehab and was determined to stay clean. Tragically, he found that the drug's powerful call took control.

Our sweet and caring son and brother died from a heroin overdose at just 18 years old.

This was five months after I left my ten-year career as a sheriff's deputy, his mom was an emergency room nurse. I coached my son's high school wrestling team and hundreds of other kids in our community. This was not supposed to happen to our family. Jordan's addiction and death dramatically changed each member of my family. 

We wanted to give Jordan a proper funeral and thanks to the wonderful people at the funeral home they allowed me to finance the $20 thousand dollar funeral.

I haven't been able to return to my career in law enforcement. The past five years I've tried to work hard to pay down this debt. Of course GoFundMe didn't exist five years ago, so we didn't ask for much help.  I'm indetbed to a small group of family and friends who have generously helped me.

Since Jordan's death I've suffered from depression and PTSD, making it difficult to keep working and pay down this debt.

I am currently working as a truck driver, making ends meet however I'm unable to repay the funeral home. I would also like to repay the few family and friends who have helped me, although they have never asked.

In Jordan's memory, or in honor of someone you love struggling with the disease of drug addiction, I humbly ask for your help to finish paying his funeral expenses.

Thank you for reading Jordan's story and thank you in advance for your help.

Support CAPUD in its Drug Decrim Action,"$6,377 CAD raised of $50,000 goal","(French version below)
The overdose epidemic continues to claim countless lives (nearly 24,000 since 2016) of persons who use drugs (PWUDs), with no end in sight. Numbers continue to grow as the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting restrictions have led to an increasingly poisoned illicit drug supply.
Current drug policies have failed to stop these deaths. Current policy proposals from politicians, such as drug treatment courts and increased funding for recovery centres will not solve this ongoing human crisis. These policy proposals fall short and fail to vindicate the human rights of PWUDs and their loved ones.

Help decrease drug-related deaths in Detroit,"$1,745 raised of $15,500 goal","I need your help to create Harm Reduction Kits that will be used to combat the opioid overdose crisis in the Detroit Area, specifically people experiencing homelessness in Detroit. Sadly, with the increase in drug-related deaths during the pandemic, more than 200 Americans die every day due to drug use. 

You may be asking yourself: What is Harm Reduction? Per Harm Reduction International, 'Harm reduction refers to policies, programs, and/or practices that aim to minimize the negative health, social and legal impact associated with drug use, policies, and laws. It is grounded in justice and human rights with a focus on positive change without judgment'. More simply, I like to think of harm reduction as meeting folks where they are at the present time to help them reduce their risks associated with drug use.  Harm reduction kits help reduce health consequences associated with drug use. For instance, harm reduction can help decrease the prevalence of HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and deaths due to overdose.  

The harm reduction kits will consist of Naloxone (Narcan), sterile syringes, biohazard sharps container, sterile cooker, sterile water, alcohol pep pads, cotton balls, condoms, and hand sanitizer. They will also include an easy to understand pocket guide that will have information on harm reduction practices for safer drug use and sex, signs of overdose, how to use Narcan, and available treatment options.

For this project, I will be working alongside , a medical student-led free clinic in Detroit that provides medical care and connections to social services for people experiencing homelessness. The plan for the harm reduction program is to closely follow-up with each person receiving a kit, provide education on harm reduction, create a space for a non-judgmental conversations about safer drug use / sex, barriers to behavior change and treatment, and treatment options. Additionally, for interested folks, the program will be helping to provide connections to treatment services. 

Briefly, about me: my name is Lianna Foster-Bey. I am a fourth year medical student at Wayne State University School of Medicine. I was recently awarded a small project award ($2000), from the Albert Schweitzer Fellowship and Authority Health, to help kickstart this harm reduction project.  While this award is enough to get started, the goal of the project is to create enough harm reduction kits to sustain 30 people experiencing homelessness for one year, so additional donations are needed. 

Thank you so much for your donation, I am immensely grateful!

Caring For Corinne- Mental Health,"$5,200 raised of $10,000 goal","Our story starts when Corinne was in 9th grade . We learned then that she suffered from depression and thoughts of suicide. She was 14 then and is now 20. Through those 6 years we have hospitalized my daughter in different facilities to help with her depression and mental health . She has seen high points as well as extremely low points in those 6 years . at 18 years old she made a suicide attempt that failed and we again had her in facilities to help with her mental health . One of the lowest points was when she chose to leave us as a family to go to California. During that time nothing good happened, she became involved with drugs hanging with people in the wrong places. At this time she was 19 so we had no communication with her. We were notified on her 20th birthday that she was addicted to meth. As any parent we were extremely upset saddened so we made our trip to California to retrieve my daughter and help save her life. We brought her back to New Jersey and we put her in treatment in South Jersey called the lighthouse since then she's been an in and out of different facilities trying to help with her drug addiction. While struggling with recovery sadly she relapsed and found a new drug called heroin which is the devil. Any parent dealing with drug addiction would understand that these drugs are horrible and they take so many lives every day. While entering recovery again at advanced health they contacted us and said the best thing for her would be to go to a place in Tennessee called the ranch for care to deal with her mental issues like PTSD and dual mental diagnosis that have led to her drug addictions. We just want to help our daughter obviously we've always wanted the best for her. Sadly this place is not covered by our insurance and out of our network. Every therapist has told us that this is the place they would send their own child that this is the place that gets them help. Unfortunately at $25,000 a month it is a very high price to pay for a middle-class family already struggling with lots of medical debt. I ask for help , help to save my daughter she really is a beautiful person with a beautiful soul that just needs guidance and the right treatment for her mental health. Any parent or loved one that's dealt with addiction and mental health issues or lost somebody to drug addiction or mental health issues will understand the want to be able to fix their loved one. If you can donate We appreciate it with all my heart if you can't please just pray for her prayers are always welcome and appreciated . God bless

Help with Memorial for my daughter,"$3,900 raised of $3,500 goal","As many of you know my daughter, Angelica has been freed from bondage. God had mercy and spared her from having to suffer any longer. He has taken her home to be with Himself. She battled with drug addiction for most of her adult life and struggled to manage her diabetes. Her greatest fight was being able to accept her worth. She was a rare soul…beautiful and loving human being. She loved animals and wanted to become a Veterinarian someday. She came shy of completing a certificate in Veterinary Assisting due to the start of her addiction. Enrolled again to complete the program but wasn’t able to. Her addiction was progressing. She always had her relationship with her Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. In and out of several outpatient and residential programs. The Phoenix Dream Center would be the most influential program that she entered where she remained sober for 4 months. Prior to entry of the program she had, at least, 20 hospital admissions within a years time. Jeannie Alvarado, her case manager, always went above and beyond her required duties along with an incredible team at Copa Health, to help Angelica recover. I am forever grateful to all who didn’t give up on her. I never gave up on her. Having to go on living without her is incomprehensible. But what’s greater than that is how blessed I feel knowing she will never hurt again. She was loved by many. I want to acknowledge her true friends. The members of Nu Hope where she attended NA meetings regularly.. They were like family to her. Ana, her oldest and dearest friend, Laura and Tony who completely accepted her for who she was. There are more but these individuals were closest to her who never gave her drugs, only their support.

Bill Box the owner of Green Valley drugs Bobbie’s boss met with her the week before she lost her job and told her that he will be closing down the fountain as of July 20, 2023 because he has taking a big loss on it and showed her all of the paper work of how much he has lost by having the fountain open.

Help Kylea get cancer drug OLAPARIB,"$41,075 AUD raised of $40,000 goal","Hi Everyone. My name is Conor Dowling. This fundraiser is one of the most emotional things I have ever had to do. Kylea Dowling is my mother. She has the biggest kindest heart out of any one I’ve ever known. For the past 10 years she’s had two battles with cancer. In 2012 Mum had Stage 3 bowel cancer and underwent chemotherapy and surgery for this . After her sisters battle with Triple Negative Breast Cancer in 2016, Mum found out that she (and her sister) had the BRCA 1 gene mutation which greatly increased her risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Mum immediately had her ovaries and uterus removed to reduce her risk of ovarian cancer and late last year had a double mastectomy to reduce her risk of Triple Negative Breast Cancer. Unfortunately this preventative surgery revealed an aggressive Triple Negative Breast Cancer growth.  Mum has just finished 6 months of chemotherapy for this. Mum now hopes to start taking Olaparib which was recently shown in the OlympiA clinical trial to significantly reduce the risk of cancer recurrence in BRCA 1 woman who are treated in the early stages of their cancer by almost 50%. To our dismay this drug isn’t available for Mum as a PBS drug which means Mum has to pay $6,950 a month and needs to take this for 12 months. When I found out that Mum wasn’t eligible to get it on the PBS I was angry and just purely disappointed in our Government for their decisions about who can access this drug at the PBS cost. For the last month,  Mum has been trying desperately to find a compassionate access program to get this drug at a reduced cost however all attempts have failed and mum will have to pay the full amount and the yearly cost will be $83,400. Our family have been through so much and this is a huge financial burden on us. But one we know we have to take to give mum the best chance of survival.  We will exhaust every avenue to fund this drug so Mum can be here for as long as possible. So to anyone who is willing to help, any donations will be more than helpful. We thank you for all your support and know that mum is fighting as much as she can to stay with us for as long as she can. Thank you and God Bless. Conor Dowling.

Help with funding children’s grief book.,"$2,790 raised of $10,000 goal","In 2016, my one-year-old son lost his father to a fentanyl overdose. To some, this may be shocking, but in the U.S. alone, 2022 KFF Health Tracking data shares that 1 in 10 adults has had a family member die over a drug overdose, with Fentanyl contributing to more than two-thirds of those cases, leaving hundreds of thousands of parents and children alike to grieve and come to terms with their new reality.

Now, trying to raise a child as a solo parent experiencing a significant loss, I realized there was a limited number of children's books tackling the heavy topic that could help navigate challenging conversations and emotions my son was feeling: (confusion, abandonment, sadness) and written in a way that children would be able to access their grief and work through it.

Battle with cancer new drug to help cure it,"$23,985 AUD raised of $45,000 goal","Hi my name is Aston Rhodes I'm 28 years young and I live in Brisbane Australia. In January 2018 I was diagnosed with a rare non-hodgkinson lymphoma cancer (Nasal NK-T Cell). Since then, I have been in and out of hosipital for treatment.

I have managed to get through 4 cycles of chemo therapy and 26 days straight of radiation therapy treatments.

After a breif break 5 months after treatment scans showed that the cancer continues to grow and a biopsy confirmed it. Unfortunately this cancer is a fast aggresive type and treatment needs to be administered as soon as possible.

The challenge I'm facing at this point is that the chemo therapy regime that has already been administered can't kill the cancer, howerver there is particular drug that may kill it. The thing is though, this drug isn't available in Australia and the public health system isn't able to help purchase it.

The drug may be able to kill the cancer and save my life. Unfortunately the drug is extremely expensive and is only available from the United States.

Due to me not being able to work for last 12 months, I simply can not afford to buy the drug. It costs $45000 (Forty five thousand dollars), which wil give me the required 8 dose of chemo therapy.

I know this is alot to ask, but any help or contribution you could provide to my chemo fund will be much appreciated, I will be forever greatfull. As i mentioned earlier your contribution could ssve my life.

Thank you for taking the time to read my story it means alot me, kind regards

She is on a chemotherapy drug that helps some. The financial strain she’s under is causing so much stress that her health issue is flaring more than usual. She worked in the Healthcare field. Again, the doer…the giver.
This Gofundme will hopefully relieve some of that stress, so she can focus on being as well as she can for her little girl. Her husband’s job doesn’t have paid time off and he just had a serious bout of Covid. The ice storm hit and he wasn’t able to work while the city shut down.

Post lung transplant housing and drug co-pay,"$4,350 raised","Hi, my name is Carol Topping, I am raising funds for post lung transplant housing and drug co-pay cost. My husband, Robert Topping, had a double lung transplant 2-26-24 at UF Shands in Gainesville, Fl and is currently in the ICU doing great. We hope to move into housing during his recuperation as we need to stay close in the area for daily testing and re-hab for 3 months.

Help My Sister and Kids Get a Fresh Start,"$9,204 raised of $15,000 goal","My big sister has had an incredibly rough time over the past 2 years and has been able to manage on her own but the time has come to ask for help and I hope that she will find support in her community and beyond. Unfortunately, two years ago her husband of over 10 years relapsed on hard drugs and refused to stop or seek help. Because it had become a dangerous situation for their three young children she was forced to hire a lawyer to have him removed from the home and start the divorce process. At this point, she has spent her entire savings on the divorce lawyer and there is still no end in sight due to them being unable to serve him because he now has no phone, car, job, or permanent residence due to drug use. He is in contempt of court due to not paying any of the bills he was ordered to pay or child support but that does not help her financial situation. She went from paying half of the household expenses to 100% in a matter of months and has managed to support her children by working overtime every single week and because of bonuses that were being offered to nurses in her department for working extra but last week those bonuses were cut in half which means even working overtime she will not be able to pay all the monthly expenses which include the new expenses of childcare for her toddler and counseling for her boys who are having a hard time adjusting to being so suddenly abandoned by their father. She cannot sell the house to downsize because until the final divorce hearing everything is still in both of their names and the situation has become dire.

Extended Stay in Drug and Eating Disorder Rehab,"$6,505 raised of $14,000 goal","This has been the most challenging experience I have ever experienced as a Mother. My fourteen-year-old daughter was hospitalized last month due to a relapse from narcotic addiction. While in the hospital, she confided she had been using drugs for a year since switching from private to public school. She also admitted to having an eating disorder. All of this was hidden from her Dad and me.

She has been in a Rehab Center out of town (30 days) and needs to stay for at least two more weeks. She was self-medicating due to mental health challenges which are being addressed by her excellent team of Doctors, Psychiatrists, and therapists.

Please Help Auden Get the Chemotherapy He Needs,"$46,032 raised of $100,000 goal","Hey friends, as many of you already know, our dear friend Auden Schraeder was diagnosed with a particularly aggressive form of brain cancer in July 2020. Since then, he’s been through brain surgery as well as multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation, and he is feeling good now and up for the fight, however, the cancer continues to come back. The first and second line chemotherapy drugs failed to suppress the tumors, so his oncology team at UCSF has prescribed a new chemotherapy drug called Verzenio, because it is known to target a specific gene identified in his cancer’s genomic sequencing. They were eager to start the new drug in hopes that this one would work, however the INSURANCE COMPANY HAS DECLINED TO PAY FOR IT! After three appeals, and three rejections, they turned to Eli Lilly’s financial assistance program, which offers the medication free of charge for some applicants. Unfortunately, they just received notice that they were not accepted into this program either… which leaves them with few options.

Help Tuesday and Isaiah Find an Apartment,"$7,885 raised of $7,500 goal","Tuesday Aton, 50, and her son Isaiah, 20, recently reunited, after years when Isaiah had been homeless on the streets of San Francisco and suffering from drug addiction. BART Police officers, including recently retired Officer Eric Hofstein, helped to reunite the mother and son.


Aton flew to San Francisco to bring Isaiah back with her to Hawaii, where he is in therapy and receiving drug treatment with Suboxone, a medication that curbs opiate cravings. Isaiah has more than two months of sobriety and has a part-time job detailing cars; his mom works as an independent ride-share driver.


Aton had been renting a small one-bedroom but the apartment would not allow another renter, and she needs to be with her son to support his recovery. Putting down a first and last month rent on a place together, along with a security deposit, will run them around $5,000 by a conservative estimate.

In addition, they need furniture; they’ve been sleeping on a comforter on the floor. They’ve been trying to stretch their food dollars. Food in the islands is famously expensive, and at times, they’ve foraged for fruits growing wild, like the Noni fruit, to supplement their meals. “We are just barely making ends meet,” Aton said. “We try to be creative.” Another $2,500 could meet their furniture needs and give them breathing space for groceries.

“It’s the most amazing feeling to see my son getting better and better, every day,” she said. “I am seeing him find new strength in himself. He’s meeting friends and having a sense of purpose, of contributing, which is so important.”

As the family works to get their feet underneath them, Aton would like to pay it forward and be a resource for other parents of children experiencing challenges of behavioral health, addiction and homelessness. “I want to keep it going,” she said.

If enough funds are raised, Aton would also like to pay for dental work for her son’s front teeth, which deteriorated during his time on the streets. They do not have private health insurance, so the only thing that would be covered presently is pulling the teeth, not repairing them, she said. To give him the best future for jobs and self-confidence, he could use funds for that work.

This GoFundMe campaign is sponsored by BART Director Bevan Dufty, who has been a strong advocate for BART’s efforts to work with community partners to help those experiencing these kinds of challenges to get connected to services and resources. 


He initiated the fundraiser after reading an article on the bart.gov website about Tuesday and Isaiah. In that article, they remained anonymous. With this GoFundMe, they are presenting their real names and financial needs to the public, in hopes of securing stable housing and meeting their other basic needs.  -

“I was so moved by the efforts that BART employees are making to help people break the cycles of homelesness and addiction,” Dufty said.

Help with medical expenses and surgery for Javen!,"$1,220 raised of $1,500 goal","Javen was diagnosed at age 1 with ulcerative colitis,  juvenile arthritis and uveitis. 2 years ago we tried several different medications to get his inflammation under control but nothing was working. During this process, he developed severe cataracts in both eyes that required his lenses be removed. They couldn't put the lenses back until the inflammation was under control for 2 years. Luckily we were able to get his eyes in remission with a drug called stelera. 

  It's now been under control for 2 years so we have his first surgery scheduled December 13th! Unfortunately this is 5 days after my husband's knee surgery and funds were already tight waiting on his surgery and his recovery. We will have to drive to St Louis December 12th-14th for his pre-admission, surgery, and post op visit, then we have to return one week later, 2 weeks after that, then the other eye will be scheduled. His insurance only covers one glasses prescription per year but it doesn't cover the high index that he needs so we will be out of pocket for his glasses during this time of transition since it is one eye at a time. Ill have to pay out of pocket for one lens first, then the second, then after both eyes are done hell need a new prescription a few months later that insurance ""should"" cover at that point. His current glasses we paid out of pocket $400 for and ill have to update the script one eye at a time until hes completely healed. Each trip costs us roughly $400, and right now we just do not have the extra money to get this done. We have worked with childrens to set up gas reimbursement,  however there's no telling when we will be reimbursed, it took a year to get reimbursed from his last surgery. Also, we've already had 2 trips in the last month that were still recovering from.

Help Cristina with Medication (ALS),"$5,341 AUD raised of $55,000 goal","My mother was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and we are making this little bag to raise funds for buying the motor assistance equipment she needs and to buy the EDARAVONE drug that is only available in the US and Japan. Her treatment, with 14 cycles, will cost $ 210,000 BRL - but it is the only medicine that has shown good results for combating the disease.




CRISTINA, 59, my mother, has always been a fighter. She educated and raised 3 children, worked hard from the beginning, and expected  a quiet old age with her grandchildren in São Luís, Maranhão (North-East Brazil). But, in November 2017, she was diagnosed with ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), a degenerative and aggressive neural disease. In just one year, my mother has already lost partial movement of her legs and arms, needing a wheelchair; her speech and breathing are also well compromised. This has required adaptation of the whole house. Mom is still following up with a neurologist, speech therapist, psychiatrist, hematologist, water aerobics instructor and physiotherapist, who, due to her difficulty in getting around, often have to be hired to come home. Besides, I am the only daughter who lives in São Luís and I have needed to greatly reduce my working hours, as a broker, because I need to stay with my mother, who can no longer be alone in the face of her limitations and the risk of gagging or falling. This has significantly reduced income and, with all the expenses, we can no longer pay a caregiver so that I may be away from home for work. Mom is taking Riluzole, and although she is undergoing this treatment, she has not regained from the disease; making the picture worse day after day.




In recent months, friends in São Luís have been mobilising efforts to obtain necessary resources for the medicine called Edaravone, which has shown good results in other countries, but has not yet been approved by Anvisa (National Sanitary Surveillance Agency) in Brazil. So, we want to import this medicine from Japan, but each cycle costs an average of $15,000 BRL, and Mom will need 14 cycles. This medication would help to control the disease and increase hope for containing the progression of symptoms. For these reasons, we have opened sources for resource collection, such as an online kitty and an account for urgent donations.




The disease gets worse every day. When your chest muscles stop working, you can’t breathe on your own.




Patients who are using this new drug are showing good results, citing examples of strength recovery, some improvements with movement and, most importantly, stagnation of the disease. All patients had to purchase Edaravone with their own funds, since, being new and not having the regulation of the government agency, it is difficult to obtain

Help Haley Pay Her Medical Bills,"$3,800 raised of $5,000 goal","Hello everyone!

My name is Bob and I'm fund-raising to to help pay off my partner's medical bills and other expenses related to her assault on Sacramento State Campus.

One night last semester, I began to worry. Haley, a full-time Masters student didn't come home at her usual time. I spent hours worried sick that something bad had happened to her. Around 10:30 that night, two of her classmates brought her home. As soon as she walked into the door, I immediately knew she was drugged.  She was blacked out, stumbling, falling dead-weight throughout the apartment. Instinct took over and I rushed her to the hospital.

We went to the local emergency room (for which she wasn't insured, and the wait at Kaiser would have taken hours) and got her into a room where she was kept all night in fear that she had a concussion from passing out and hitting her head on a desk. Later we find out that she had acute benzodiazapine toxicity, a drug often used to take advantage and assault women.

She has been in and out of jail and living in all kinds of unsafe places. So many of us have been praying for her and believing for a better life for her.  Three months ago she got out of jail and has been living with Joel and Elizabeth Frlan who have encouraged and loved her and helped her stay clean. She has been accepted into Anna Ogden Hall in Spokane, which is an amazing faith based recovery program. She is so excited to start this program. In order to be eligible, she has to be sober for 30 days and have all fines paid off in the next 3 weeks. This is where you come in!!  She has fines and child support back pay that total $3000. Clearly this is a very overwhelming number for her, but I believe that if all the people who love Ashley join together, we could make this money quite easily. Those who have been helping with her recovery lately feel that Anna Ogden Hall is an excellent next step for bringing Ashley to health and wholeness, but she cannot do this until these debts are paid off.  She had been completing community service and showing up for court dates, really doing her part well. Will you partner with Ashley financially so she can make it to the finish line!? Every little bit helps and your support will strengthen Ashley deeply on her journey to freedom. Thank you so much for your generosity in her life.

Help Patsy Beat Cancer!,"$2,293 raised of $5,000 goal","On April 16, 2020 my life, and the lives of my family, changed forever. Our beloved grandmother Patsy Walker, who was told just 4 months prior that she was in remission, was again diagnosed with Lung Cancer.

Patsy's first diagnosis of lung cancer, in 2019, was met with an aggressive round of chemo therapy that left her extremely weak and on the brink of death. Though she was exhausted, she fought with everything she had and in December of 2019 was told that she was cancer free, that she was in remission. 

All was well until she went in for a routine check-up in April of 2020. Test were run and scans were made. The worst possible news came soon after, she was going to have to fight for her life again, the cancer had returned. Not only had it returned, but it had spread.

Doctors are adamant about not doing another round of chemo therapy due to how it almost killed her last time. They do have another option, a different drug that may help to cure her cancer.

This drug though, after insurance coverage, is still $4000 out of pocket. This is a lot of money for someone who is retired and living on a fixed income. So I humbly come to you, to ask for any assistance you may be able to give in these very trying times. God bless you all.

Nicole Smith-Holt's Quest for Affordable Insulin,"$5,225 raised of $5,000 goal","Nicole Smith-Holt has dedicated her life to fight in the memory of her son and to save other lives. Let’s support Nicole in her mission to make insulin affordable for all.


Nicole Smith-Holt has been a tireless advocate for insulin affordability after her 26 year old son, Alec, died in June of 2017. Alec worked full-time as a restaurant manager but did not have health benefits. After losing his mother’s insurance when he turned 26, he was shocked that his insulin and supplies would cost $1,300 per month. He had only $1,000 in his bank account so he decided to try to stretch out his remaining insulin until his next paycheck. He was found dead of diabetic ketoacidosis in his apartment just three days before he was paid.

Nicole has now dedicated her life to ensuring that no one ever again will die because they can’t afford their insulin. Nicole has shared Alec’s story countless times, receiving coverage in dozens of articles and broadcasts in state, national, and international news (see the story links below.) In January, Nicole was appointed by Minnesota’s Attorney General to co-chair a newly established Minnesota Prescription Drug Task Force. She’s also an active volunteer on the executive committee of the Minnesota Chapter of #insulin4all and as T1International’s Charity Ambassador. On Tuesday, February 5, 2019, Nicole will be US Senator Amy Klobuchar’s guest at the State of the Union address. On top of her advocacy work, Nicole works two jobs and is a busy mom supporting her three living children.

This GoFundMe has been established to allow Nicole and Alec’s dad, James Holt Jr., to further their mission by supporting them to travel to attend hearings, testify in congress, advocate for insulin policies, and dedicate more time to advocacy. Additionally, the family would like to offer a scholarship in Alec’s name to a senior graduating from his high school this spring.

Help Katlyn Cover Medical Costs in the US,"$4,391 raised of $7,000 goal","Donation perks can be found below my ""story"".
As many of you know, a few months ago I moved to the United States with my partner Luke so that he could start a new job at NYU. We were hesitant about leaving Germany because last year I found out that I have hypothyroidism and I was also finally able to receive adequate treatment for my anxiety disorder. Leaving Germany meant leaving affordable healthcare, affordable medication, and accessible mental health services. Both of us are from countries where we have never had to decide between groceries or seeing a doctor, but that is the position we are in now.

Before we said “yes” to moving to the United States we reviewed our options for health insurance carefully, and we realized it would be very, very tight, but that we could probably make it work. It was a very hard decision, because in the long term, moving here is a great choice in the right direction, but I do need medical care here and now. We thought we would be able to make it work though. Unfortunately there have been some unexpected road blocks. To receive the treatment I need, I have to repeat all the tests I did in Germany with an American doctor. They will not just continue treatment as it was because they do not trust my German documentation, and if something was off I suppose they are worried about being liable. This means I have to have blood tests all over again, ultrasounds all over again, and frequent visits all over again, until they can be sure that my thyroid medication is doing what it should be doing. Once they are satisfied, I will hopefully only need my blood taken once every 6 months. Suddenly there is a big pile of appointments I need to go to, but I have to stagger them as best as I can and as much as they will allow depending on urgency, because we cannot pay for insurance, plus co-pay for each visit, plus medication, plus referred specialists all at once. The type of hypothyroidism is a very manageable and common condition. It remains manageable as long as everything is in check. When it's in check, all I need is one little pill every morning, and nearly all my symptoms are kept at bay. When it's in check, I will rarely need to see the doctor to take care of it. If it's not in check, I will get very sick. When not in check, it is even life-threatening. 

On top of this I am also seeking care for anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I have found an affordable social worker/therapist. However I must also see a psychiatrist to manage medication and other aspects of therapy. In Germany and in Canada, my GP is who managed this for me. In fact in Germany, my GP is who managed every aspect of my thyroid issues as well. I imagine in the United States there is more of an incentive for doctors to give specialist referrals. It is inconvenient for me, but more importantly it’s also much more expensive. But this is care that I need as much as I need my thyroid medication. Without managing my thyroid disorder, I would die. Without managing my mental health, I would also die.

Per my visa stipulations as a spouse, I cannot work until I apply for another aspect of my visa. I had to wait a certain amount of time before I was allowed, but it also costs money ($400 USD) that we do not have. I want to work and make enough money to at least pay for my medical bills going forward. But even once I pay to file this form, it could take months to get approved. I haven’t worked for a handful of years. Between my mental and physical health, it hasn’t been possible. Finally, we are in a country where I am allowed employment when I get approved. And finally I am on my way to feeling well enough that I could work a part-time job, which should be enough to pay for my medical bills.

It probably looks like we live a glamorous life of globetrotting, but the reality is that travel and living all over the world is part of Luke’s job. I can quite honestly say that in my entire adult life, I have only gone on one very short trip for pleasure. Everything else has been because Luke had a conference, or we had friends and family to visit far away, that we only get to see once or twice a year, if that. We have not been out here, blowing it all on travelling the world for fun. It has been in large part for work. When we got married, we didn't have a wedding, we didn't have a honeymoon. We don't own a car, we don't own a home. We don't have pets, we don't have children. We have no large expenses in our life; we cannot afford them. But we do work. We work very hard. Anyone who knows Luke knows that he is very dedicated to his job and has an incredibly strong work ethic. As do I, or at least I did, until I left Canada and then wasn't well enough to work. If I was in Canada now I would have disability coverage. And I would have healthcare, no questions asked. I have certainly paid into it. I always had a job. Always. Since age 12. I’ve never been fired, always promoted, worked in the service industry and then the arts and arts education right up until I left Canada. The last 4 years, if I could have worked, I would have. If I could have I might have been able to better prepare for the situation with healthcare we are in. We work very hard and we live a very simple life in a little studio apartment in a suburb. We do not live beyond our means, except that I dare to have a chronic illness that I cannot control or manage without medical intervention.

My father's medications have been constantly shuffled around since the beginning of his diagnosis to try to keep him consistent regarding his MELD (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) Score (Currently 12) and some of the most recent medications my father has been prescribed include Jenuvia, Xifaxin, Lokelma, Ursodiol which are very pricey medications even after my father's Medicare pays for its portion of the prescribed medication. My dad recently went to see his liver specialist and was told to consider having a liver transplant done as the liver tissue will only degenerate due to the nature of the disease and this is an option that was discussed in detail between the physician & patient. He was referred to Universal Hospital in San Antonio so that he could be evaluated for a possible liver transplant however after my father further researched this option he did not feel comfortable with this route as he has legitimate concerns about the condition of his health, the affordability of the procedure, and the affordability of the life-enabling auto-immune medication he would require for the rest of his life if he was approved for a liver transplant.

Help Arash Access Medication,"$4,750 CAD raised of $4,800 goal","My brother, Arash, was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis at the age of four, which is the most fatal genetic disease according to CF Canada. CF has no cure. It affects the entire body and especially the lungs. CF patients have difficulty breathing, digesting nutrients, and they are prone to diabetes and other conditions. We are extremely grateful that Arash is relatively stable by taking on daily physiotherapy and respiratory treatments. He takes various medications every day that are integral to his livelihood. One serious challenge he faces, on top of his condition, is the cost of his medication. He moved to Toronto to be with his family and in the circle of family support; however, his immigration application has been under review for over a year; therefore, as a visitor, he is not eligible for Ontario Health Insurance Program, or any other support programs that cover Canadian residents. He has been solely responsible for his entire health care expenses in the past two years that he's been in Toronto, but his savings are not enough to cover his daily medication.

The absence  of these treatments are life threatening. In the past days, his medication has been running low resulting in reduced intake, which has taken a toll on him. He struggles to breathe because his lungs, functioning at only 30%  capacity, need the help of the inhalation treatments to function. Aside from low lung function, he constantly fights bacterial lung infection due to his condition, meaning he's always taking antibiotics to control the infection in the lungs. Despite all this, Arash is a fighter. He has had a successful career in IT industry, and looks forward to upgrading his eduction in Canada toward fulfilling his goals. Help him access life sustaining medication, so his dreams are not shattered while fighting CF every hour of every day. This fund will help him pay for his daily medication in the next 10 months. 

He also needs to be treated by the health care team at CF adult clinic at Michael's Hospital. He is hoping to hear from the immigration office soon enough as he understands the cost of hospitalization is simply not affordable. 

Please help me raise $1700 by the end of May 2020. Every penny counts. Thank you for kindness and support.

Healthcare Equity through Community Pharmacy,"$3,796 raised of $250,000 goal","Sozo Wellness Pharmacy was opened by Dr Shadreka McIntosh just over a 2 years ago in Fort Myers, FL to serve the needs of a previously existing pharmacy desert in the Dunbar community. Prior to our opening, the nearest pharmacy was close to 3 miles away from this historical and predominantly African-American community. As a 4th generation native of the Dunbar Community, Dr McIntosh's desire was to open an all inclusive, personalized, and wellness focused pharmacy, that endeavors to address health equity issues in under-resourced communities. When people do not have access to a pharmacy in their neighborhood, they often delay getting critical medications for chronic health issues.

Since opening in the height of the Delta variant surge, Sozo Wellness Pharmacy has been established as a pillar of trust that provides culturally responsive care and education for our community. We have hosted various health education seminars, partnered with social service agencies, provided access to medical care via our onsite nonprofit primary care provider, Samaritan Wellness. We have also established partnerships that assist with providing free or affordable medications such as Dispensary of Hope and becoming one of the first Florida Department of Health Drug Donation Program site. In a community where distrust of the healthcare industry is present, having a wellness hub to provide access and comfort, is vitally important to removing barriers and improving health outcomes.

Medical Assistance For Dylan Gardner,"$1,765 raised of $15,000 goal","My Brother, Dylan Gardner was diagnosed with Epilepsy two years ago. He is only 22 years old. After a move to North Carolina from Texas he began suffering from seizures, but no one knew why. It took a long time for neurologists to finally say it was Epilepsy.  Epilepsy has changed his life in a myriad of ways. He can no longer pursue his passion for being a firefighter, a dream that he began in Kyle, Texas. He can no longer drive a vehicle. He has had to sacrifice activities that most of us take for granted.  His love of woodworking and building furniture for people to enjoy has been one of the few solaces in his life.  Once he was diagnosed with Epilepsy, it was a difficult road to put him on a medication that would help him. After many medications he was prescribed Vimpat. Vimpat was the only medication he could take that would eradicate the seizures. The problem was, it costs almost $1000 a month. Medicaid wouldn't cover him, and we were left with no options. However, with the help of his doctor we contacted the manufacturer and were able to get it for free. Up until about a month ago. He had a job as a mechanic, had insurance, then had a seizure at work. He got fired. Now, he cannot receive assistance from the manufacturer because of insurance issues. His supply of medication is withering away. No amount of coupons or discount codes makes the prescription affordable for him. Hence, why I am asking for help. He has done so much for other, without asking for anything. Quietly dealt with this life altering illness, without complaint, and without giving up. He is one of the strongest people I know, and I strive to have even a sliver of strength as he does. Without this medication, he will have seizures, multiple times a day, severe enough that could take his life. He has to have this medication, there is only one other option and that would be brain surgery. A surgery that is supposed to be a last resort if the medication ceases to work, not because he can't afford it. All donations will go to getting his medication and any medical bills he has or will accrue. If you can't donate, please share with friends or family, if only for raising awareness of the difficulty of receiving life saving medicine. I thank you all, and Dylan thanks you too. God Bless.

Jackie’s Medication,"$2,500 raised of $2,500 goal","My mom Jackie was diagnosed with stage 4 uterine cancer on January 13, 2020. That next Tuesday, she started chemo treatments. The cancer has spread through her uterus, ovaries, bowel, and lunges. Since her diagnosis the doctors have found that it is not uterine cancer because of her response to the chemo. They are still no completely sure about her diagnoses but they know is OBG cancer. Several of her tumors have shrunk but other have began to form. She has started doing new treatment. The first portion is Keytruda and with the treatment she is needing to take Lenvima as a supplement. That being said, her new medication is $2,500 for the first month and $1,100 each month after. The doctors tried to find a different form of treatment that may be more affordable but the doctors said this treatment is her best course of action for her. The Lenvima is a pill that she will need to stay on the rest of her life if it is successful. I understand these are hard times but anything you can do will help. My parents are both retired and live on a fixed income. Even if you can’t donate please pray for my mother. We are a God believing family and know God is still in the miracle business. God is going to provide. God Bless You!","Akron, OH"
Help pay for Martin Fuller's Cancer Medicine,"$2,690 raised of $30,000 goal","Martin Fuller was diagnosed with Prostate cancer about two years ago. At that time he was receiving medical assistance through the state. during that time he went through testing, surgery and a lot of doctor appointments. All of this was just to keep cancer under control. Even with this, his cancer progressed to stage 4 metastatic cancer(cancer in the bones). He was then placed on the cancer medication known as Xtandi. Xtandi is keeping his cancer from continuing to spreading to the rest of his body. Three months ago he was kicked off state assistance because between SSDI and his part-time job(he's not allowed to work full time), he made too much money. And unfortunately, affordable health care(Obama Care) will not cover this medication nor are we able to find affordable help and/or coverage. We have desperately looked for other assistance in paying for his Xtandi and have been able to find assistance to bring his cost down to just under 2k a month, down from 8k. And that is if he continues to qualify for the discount. Still not affordable for someone living on SSDI and a part-time job.

Help us pay for our baby's heart medication,"$4,102 raised of $4,064 goal","Early October of 2021 we were blessed with the most perfect, beautiful little boy. He was born with a rare heart defect known as Truncus Arteriosus Type 2.
We were aware of his condition throughout the pregnancy and therefore were able to prepare his treatment before he arrived. BH. He had life saving heart surgery at 3 days old and is since 4 months old and doing well, thank G-d.
He takes multiple medications, multiple times a day. His insurance covers all of the medications but one of them. The most important one.
That one medication costs us $118 per month. We have tried many different pharmacies and have had no luck. With us having 3 kids, and lots of expenses, it's not something that is easily affordable. It's not in our nature to be comfortable asking for this kind of help but it is taking a toll on our financial situation.

Become part of the Substance Abuse solution!,"$1,160 raised of $15,000 goal","Thank you for stopping by.

Welcome to the Earlene Clinic, PLLC. We are an outpatient substance and alcohol abuse treatment facility, located in Rockingham, N.C, that delivers Medication Assisted Treatment to our clients. What makes us different? Simply put: we do not turn patients away due to finances. Unlike other organizations that sometimes focus simply on what insurance a patient has (or unaffordable sliding scales), we do our best to make treatment affordable. No patient is ever turned away due to ablility to pay for treatment. The clinic works with and treats everyone: insured, under insured, self pay, unemployed, etc. We also offer a reasonable sliding scale for those without insurance but our payment scale is income driven and affordable. We understand addiction, and we understand the best opportunity to break the cycle and help people is when they are in need of the help. The reason this Go Fund Me account was established is that we have been approached a number of times by both client associates and member of the community asking how they can help, and how to donate to the clinic to help our patients. The more we raise the more affordable care we can deliver to those who need it most. Our gracious partners at Lab Corp are assisting in the cost of urine, while we ourselves have lowered the cost of seeing a health care professional. However, the cost of medications can be prohibitively expensive. This is where your donations are needed the most. Our motto is ""Take Back Your Life, Write a New Story."" We live here. We work here. We are part of the community and we understand the problems. So, if you can, please donate to help someone in the grips of addiction. Help someone write a new story. Help save a life today and close the gap to affordable care. Thank you for your time.

Comet was recently diagnosed with dry FIP, which is a rare disease caused by a mutation of feline Coronavirus.

Historically, FIP was seen as a death sentence and the only ""treatment"" available was euthanasia. Thankfully, there is now an experimental drug called GS-441524 that has saved the lives of many cats. There are tons of success stories thanks to this drug.

Urgent! The Smith Family Needs Our Help! UPDATE!,"$60,344 raised of $65,000 goal","We are very moved and grateful to receive such a tremendous response from all of you. I am asking that your generosity will continue as Sheila will not give up even under these terrible circumstances. Due to everyone's support she is able to continue to fight! God Bless You All!
Update from Pat:
Hello, first, we wish to thank all of you. If not for your prayers, thoughts and generosity our chances of being here as a family this Christmas would be very slim indeed. Last fall Sheila ended up with blood clotting in her leg and a pulmonary embolism in both lungs. The wonderful staff at St. Joseph's treated her and placed an IVC filter in her as a precaution for the next several months. During her fight over the past few months, her mobility has been very diminished and she is bed bound right now. We are trying to get more P.T. and O.T. sessions approved with the insurance company in hope that she can gain some of her core strength back to allow her to sit up. It is such a struggle of ups and downs. Our goal is for her to eventually be able to use a wheelchair. Getting from home to her infusion and other appointments is very painful for her. Any recommendations regarding affordable stretcher transport would really be appreciated. We are attempting to participate in a new trial. A medication called AOH1996 as it sounds very promising. We reached out to her oncology team for guidance.

Help Buck receive the medical care he needs!❤️,"$1,090 CAD raised of $5,000 goal","Hi, my name is April and I am wanting to raise money for my dear friends Stacey & Brenden’s golden retriever Buck as he undergoes medical treatment for immune mediated thrombocytopenia (IMTP). Buck went to the groomer on Dec.6 and she had noticed bruising on his stomach and immediately notified Stacey. After being brought to the vet numerous times for blood work in which his platelet count was 24 and normal range is 117-490 he was given a plasma transfusion. We are hoping his platelet count will increase with the new medications & diet he has been put on. Buck is on bed rest until his count is higher to prevent any bleeding. There is a long road ahead for Buck but with the amazing care from Warman Small Animal hospital and your help Stacey & Brenden will be able to continue to pay for his treatments. $5000 will not even cover what they have already paid and future costs but any little bit is so helpful and I know will be so appreciated by this family.

"Insurance Denied, Suffering Permitted",$620 raised of $400 goal,"Hello everyone Shaina here. Please open your hearts for a moment as I share my dear friend Rachel’s story…
Rachel has struggled with Fibromyalgia for over 10 years. It causes her daily pain, most of which is controlled by a medication called Savella. This life-giving medication has been denied by her insurance and she is being forced to wean herself off with the remaining medication she has. If she used it all up and didn't wean herself off, she would become violently ill as well as racked with immense, uncontrollable pain for days. Possible causing her to lose her job, making it impossible to take care of herself or her family. Not only is Rachel the best friend you could ever have, she is a dog mom to three adorable pups & an amazing auntie. Rachel is employed full time though as the only present income earner in her household her much needed medication is not affordable at present. Rachel is a selfless human and would not reach out for assistance on her own. That is why my heart and soul urged me to reach out on her behalf. I can no longer see or allow my dear friend to suffer in silence.

Blessings for Lincoln,"$8,425 raised of $15,000 goal","My late husbands best friend has a journey ahead in advocating for his son. Joseph, his beautiful wife Diane and big sister Madison want nothing more than to bring sweet baby boy Lincoln home and provide him with the very best medical care. 

Currently this precious family is facing a prescription cost of up to $4,000 monthly for the ONLY medication available to treat Lincoln’s Tuberous Sclerosis. Their insurance does NOT and will not cover this medication. The pharmaceutical company is currently not showing compassion. They are working HARD alongside the Dr. to fight both the insurance and pharma to work out a more affordable plan. However, they cannot go home without this medication. 

Let me be very clear. The Hardy family is not in financial despair. Both of them have jobs and they both work hard. 

I personally believe (against Joseph’s wishes of course) that this family should not experience a change to their lifestyle merely because their insurance is refusing to cover the medication. 

Every penny of this will be used directly for Lincoln’s medical care. This is not the Hardy vacation fund :) This is a way to directly love on sweet Lincoln and allow his parents a small break to worry about finances and just focus on their beautiful family of four.

Global Hep C Support Project,"$28,209 AUD raised of $200,000 goal","Providing Affordable Hepatitis C Medication to the Planet's Poor

I started this Go Fund Me project back in 2016 to try to raise enough money to buy a bulk purchase of Hep C medicines at a discounted price that would enable me to supply people in impoverished situations Hep C medicines at around the price of US$300 per treatment.
This year, 2021, thanks to the support of hundreds of people, this goal was achieved and I am now supplying the 12 weeks pan-genotype treatment of Sofosbuvir + Daclatasvir for US$300 to poor people who qualify  for the support of this low price.

The price of US$300 is my cost price for a 12 weeks supply of Sofosbuvir + Daclatasvir, including shipping and handling and general overheads.

Having reached this goal I had intended to wind up this project, however, a number of people contacted me and expressed the desire to donate  to directly help poor people to buy their Hep C medicines, I decided to keep the project going but change the goals.

So this site is now accepting donations that will be used to subsidize the purchase price of US$300 to bring it down to between US$100 and US$200, depending on a person's situation.
In rare cases, these donations will be used to supply medicines for free but my general philosophy is that, if possible, people should make some personal investment in their cure.
So each case will be assessed on its merits.
So if you would like to help someone who is in a poverty situation be able to access Hepatitis C treatment then please donate here.
If you wish that your donation goes to a person of a particular gender or nationality you can let me know and I will make sure that happens.

thanks

Help My Amazing Parents Get Through Hard Times,"$5,197 CAD raised of $10,000 goal","Hello everyone my name is Kyle, I am a loving son making this for my Incredible parents.   Please take the time to read my parents story.

It’s never easy to ask for help, and sometimes it’s hard to offer it too.
My parents are pushing through the most difficult time of their lives in a place of excessive uncertainty. It hurts me to watch any parent struggle after years of selflessness and dedication to making sure their kids have all the opportunities and experiences to succeed as young adults.  My mother and father, Erin and Gunars Strauts have been hustling their whole lives to create a stable life for their family.  They have been huge additions to their community and always loving and giving to their friends and family.  I am sure everyone gets my moms family Christmas Card every year :).  They have come across some hard times and their health is not well. They have also been evicted from their rental home of 10 years. Already going through one huge emergency move on January 31st.  We got them into a temporary unit until April 31st, but they will have to move again.  Their health and medication costs combined with their moving costs are quite unsustainable and they require a little buffer to make it through this next year, while we search for something more sustainable.  Since the CPP they receive is negligible toward said costs I am humbly asking for some support from the network of lovely humans to which they have given so much.  
If you are able to help, I am grateful for your support. If you are not at this time, please pass along your positive vibes, share this and pray to help my family through this challenging time.  Also if affordable opportunities for my parents to live in a home arise, we will gladly take advice and support in that regard.

Funding will go towards:
*Medical + Medication Costs
*Mover costs (Truck + Labor etc)
*Rent Supplementation - Until an affordable option arises

This support would mean the world to me and my parents and I have a strong faith we will get through it all stronger and wiser.  My gratitude goes out to any and all that provide a helping hand in any way.  

Love

The Strauts Family.

Jamie McKinnis in Hospice,"$17,440 raised of $110,000 goal","It saddens me to tell you about Jamie. She entered home hospice on August 24th. I'm trying to keep her laughing. However, she cries in pain while looking beautiful with her thick and long hair. Please leave her an encouraging note at the bottom of this page by the donations section.

I met Jamie before she married David Chafkar. So it's been 20 years of knowing them! Jamie has always been very unselfish and strong. She's still unselfish and trying to be strong. However, she needs us now. If she could still be out there rescuing cats she would. You might not know she rescued over 500 fur babies during a nine year span. She's very humble asking us for our gifts of love through donations.

Jamie's body is now fighting stage 4 cancer, Scleroderma Disease, Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD), Leukemia, and Lupus. Unfortunately, Jamie had to bury her three brothers whom passed away from the same diseases. She buried all three within six years. She became sick and diagnosed 2 1/2 years ago. Then, she had her first surgery. The surgery wasn't a success. Somehow, while she was in the hospital, ""snake oil"" doctor's paid her a visit. They had an eight sessions treatment to build up her immune system. Of course, David and Jamie did everything they could to raise the money. The unsuccessful treatments cost them $320,000. The ""doctors"" said ""sorry."" They sold everything of any value. They borrowed from many creditors.

They moved into a rental because the house sold.  They signed the lease during her illness and under duress. When the lease came due, Jamie was physically unable to move. The doctor wrote a letter to the agent/broker stating Jamie wasn't able to move. Her body couldn't take being homeless. So, the lease was executed and went month-to-month. The realtor increased their rent almost 60% a few months ago. On August 24th, they received a 30-day notice. The owner has decided to sell the house. They anticipate a move would cost them $10,000. That amount would include first, last, deposit, movers and supplies.

Jamie had surgery two weeks ago. They reconstructed her spine and several lumbar. I'm grateful to say that Jamie survived her three ""code blue."" Yes, sadly Jamie died on the table three times. We're all so grateful that she's back home.

Prior to the last surgery, Jamie was prescribed medications that's not affordable. One prescription alone was $12,000. Her ""normal"" monthly medications are over $1500.

Jamie had a procedure scheduled for August 25th. (Don't forget that Jamie coded three times this month.) The cardiologist denied the surgery. On August 25th she met with the surgeon. She was scheduled to have three different areas operated on during the previous surgery. They were only able to operate on one area (due to coding). The cardiologist has denied the other two surgeries as an option. The only treatments approved are stem cells. Those treatments aren't covered by her insurance. Therefore, they will have to pay $32,000 for this miracle.

David still has to make a living while caring for Jamie. They can't survive at this rate. They can't afford the medications to keep her alive and attempt to alleviate her body of pain.

Just the move, stem cell, medications not currently being affordable total above $60,000. They'll still have to maintain the rent, utilities, food, $1500 monthly medication currently affordable. I assume that Jamie will be needing safety equipment at home like shower bench, walker, wheelchair, etc.

Please pray for them everyday. Please donate any amount that you can afford. On behalf of Jamie and David, they humbly accept and extend their gratitude.

Don't forget to share this page on all of your social media, text, email, word of mouth etc... Thank you!

Support Charlie Boys recovery,"£1,155 raised of £1,000 goal","My beautiful brother dog Charlie Boy has taken seriously ill after having an operation to remove 2x cancer lumps on 29th November. This was going to cost £2300 which we as a family agreed was affordable. And a successful removal of the cancer. + £500 for medication after at home. Unfortunately he had a bad reaction in surgery to the anaesthetic causing him to vomit excessively, not keeping food, water or his medication down. He was in pain stopping him eating all together due to burning his oesophagus and throat. After 9 days of this trauma at home with a number of visits to the vets, he was then admitted to Wear surgery in Sedgefield on 7th December. At this vet surgery he then had further anaesthetic for investigation, bloods and scans to find the root problems to this side effect. All costing more money. He is now having the appropriate treatment and got home for Christmas, but showing slow improvement, as still needing lots of medication and trips to the vets. We are so worried and crippled with approximately £10,000 vet and medication bills only going up weekly. The pressure is unbearable from all angles and even with my family all chipping in what we have it's still not enough.He is our everything and otherwise a fit, healthy beautiful soul. Making all of this even harder to bare because in himself he was fine with many years still left in him until this surgery! Any help in these distressing hard times would be beyond appropriate.

Help Zhen beat FIP,"$1,111 raised of $8,000 goal","Please support me as I embark on the long haul to save my rescue and foster, Zhen.

For lack of better words, Zhen is fighting for his life, as he has been diagnosed with Neurological FIP (Feline Infectious Peritonitis). Luckily, there is a cure, but it is not FDA-approved, readily available, or affordable. The good news is IT WORKS. I have recently finished the 84-day journey with another rescue, Frank, and he is currently halfway through his ""observation period"" to ensure he is fully cured. The bad news is I am tapped out financially and need your help to provide Zhen with the lifesaving medication he needs.

The challenge we face is great. Unlike Wet or Dry FIP, treatment for Neuro FIP is incredibly rigorous and often surpasses the typical 84-day timeline. Zhen will require TWICE the amount of medication daily to combat the disease for a cat his size. Which means, you guessed it, double the cost. This dose and price will increase as he becomes healthier and gains weight.

Help A Retired Nurse Recover From Life Support,"$2,215 raised","Hello everyone. My name is Gabrielle and I am making this GoFundMe on behalf of my mom, Pamela Martin. She is a retired critical care and burn nurse who is currently fighting for her life at the Cleveland Clinic. My mom was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease called ANCA vasculitis several years ago and survived a brutal attack on her immune system but it left her kidneys in poor condition. Because of this, she was placed on dialysis and became an ideal patient in spite of the health challenges she was fighting. She lost 100 lbs, she went from needing dialysis 3 times a week to only going twice or at times once a week. She became the clinics poster girl for how to thrive while in kidney failure. Her kidney function was getting better and better. This past spring, the clinic she goes to decided to take her off of the medicine that had been working perfectly fine and placed her on a cheaper medication that caused her to begin having a terrible allergic reaction to it. She reported it to the clinic and was ignored. They refused to switch her back to the original medication. My moms health began to quickly decline. She petitioned another time after several more visits to the emergency room for trouble breathing and severe abdominal pain. She was again denied the medicine. My mother lived in pain for months, and after 2 months and seeing the condition she was in, they finally gave it to her. This new medication caused her auto immune disorder to flare up horrible and since she has now developed lymphoblastic lymphoma and is now on life support within three weeks. My mom has a long road ahead of her and my family has been doing all that we can but we now need support. Any donation helps. Thank you on behalf of my family and most importantly, my mom.

IVF Journey/#2,"$4,550 raised of $10,000 goal","UPDATE:
IVF # 1 -October 2018/ Failed

Unfortunately my body responded poorly to the ""cheaper"" medication, so I have to use the expensive stuff just to be comfortable. Which means it will cost about $5000-$7000 for my next cycle.
Of course I feel terrible that so many people helped and it didn't work. I feel like I let you all down, I'm sorry.  We plan to try and save money and try again next year.

Help Us Pay For Solana’s Emergency Surgery!,"$995 raised of $5,000 goal","Hi! Our names are Stacy and Anthony.
We own a 4-year old, recently adopted Boxer named Solana. We named her Solana because she loves to lay and soak in the sunlight, and run around and play with her family. She recently had puppies, but unfortunately the shelter separated them. She is a friendly, loving dog who loves to get pets from all strangers, and will get sad when passerby's don’t say hello.

Her previous owners chose not to perform the cosmetic surgery of trimming her ears or docking her tail, which is common in boxers. You may have seen boxers with short, square ears and short, stubby tails, but Solana was granted the luxury of keeping her natural features. Unfortunately, this has lead to painful days and nights for Solana, and ultimately the emergency amputation of her tail. In the past weeks, we’ve had to take her to multiple vet appointments to take care of her tail. She was diagnosed with a bad case of “At first, it was mild and she only needed for it to be wrapped and looked after. Over time, the pain became unbearable. Despise the pain medication, tail bandages, cones, and vet visits, Solana’s tail was too painful for her to bear, and this is where the tragedy begins.

Beirut Explosion Aid: Medicines to Lebanon,"$4,853 CAD raised of $5,000 goal","Hi everyone, 

My name is Emelie El-Hage. I am a provisional pharmacist and Lebanese expat living in Alberta, Canada.  

As you may have heard, a massive explosion rocked the city of Beirut resulting in numerous casualties and thousands injured. Moreover, the explosion left hundreds of thousands of people homeless, hungry and unable to afford essential healthcare services and medications. Lebanon’s economy was in a state of crisis prior to the disaster, with an economy plagued with debt, plunging currency, increasing poverty, as well as having an underfunded health care system riddled with drug shortages. Unfortunately, this disaster has catapulted a nation already in the depths of a crisis to widespread despair with many people losing their homes, their livelihoods and their ability to access healthcare and affordable medications.
 


In order to achieve my goal, I have collaborated with  - a charitable foundation committed to increasing access of medicines in vulnerable communities. HPIC provides high quality and approved medications from the Canadian market to be exported to NGOs in Lebanon and distributed, free of charge, by healthcare professionals in primary care centres. I am asking for your help and generosity to generate the funds that are necessary for the procurement and shipment of these medications from Canada to trusted sources in Lebanon. HPIC is a trusted organization with extensive experience in importing medications into Lebanon and, therefore, it is ensured by HPIC that the medications will be delivered to the hands of trusted entities. Furthermore, a list of the participating NGOs will be provided shortly and for more information regarding HPIC please visit:



My guarantee to you is 100% transparency on this page with updates and proof every step of the way.

Ricardo Seixeiro's battle with Multiple Sclerosis,"$5,200 raised","Hello, I am Marlene Seixeiro and 3 years ago my younger brother, Ricardo, was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. For those that do not know what MS is, it is a nerve-wrecking disease that makes your immune system attack your own nerve cells, disrupting the signals between your brain and body. Many of you know my little brother and how strong minded of a person he is. He walks his own path and does everything for himself. He doesn't take well to hand outs, and that is why my family has decided to step in. Three years ago, he came to my parents' house, and we knew something was off. He couldn't keep his balance and his face was frozen on one side. We all thought he had a stroke. It took a lot of coaxing, but we finally got him to go to the hospital. After months of testing his doctor diagnosed him with MS and was able to get him started on medication that allows him to keep living his life as normal as possible. They helped him find ways, such as coupons through the manufactures, that enabled him to afford the medication. He has had to switch insurance companies' multiple times because not only are they not affordable, but they do not cover the medication he needs. He found something that works and wants to continue on it instead of constant trial and error and having to switch doctors every year. I am turning to GoFundMe as a last resort. My brother does not want to go on disability and live off taxpayer money. He is limited but capable of getting to work daily and living a semi normal life however, the coupon for the medication that works for him has expired and in order to renew his medication his copay is $9000.00 every three months. We live in a time that pharmaceutical companies want us to be sick so they can continue to profit. MS is a disease that sneaks up on you, it is not a choice that someone wakes up one day and decides I want to live with this for the rest of my life. I hope in some way this has touched you enough to help in any way you can. Thank you in advance for taking the time to read his story! He might not like us for this one, but he is not only my little brother, but he is also a son, a big brother, an uncle, a cousin, a nephew and a friend. We all want to see him live his best possible life for as long as he can. Any little bit helps!

Help our 4 month old puppy walk again,"$1,680 raised","Hi, our names are Rachel and John Connors and this is our Australian Shepherd puppy, Cider. We are newlyweds just out of college, and we were so excited to start our small family when we brought home the sweetest little puppy in August. We were initially drawn to Cider because she was the runt and was much more timid than her littermates, but over the last few months that we've had her, she's turned into a very fun and spunky pup. She always has the biggest smile on her face and has brought so much joy to our lives.

Unfortunately, we had to rush her to the Emergency Vet over the weekend, because while she was running around and playing, she jumped a little too high and landed on her leg wrong. She was screaming in pain and her left hind leg was curled up at her side. When we got to the vet they took X-rays, and told us that she severely fractured her tibia. It's a spiral fracture, which can be very difficult to heal on its own, often requiring surgery if the bone is out of alignment. Thankfully, Cider's bone is still in alignment, so we were presented two options for recovery: the surgery, which promotes the best outcome, but would cost us between $5,000-$7,000, or weekly splint changes with follow up x-rays, which is more affordable, but has higher risks, and could be similar in cost to the surgery in the long run if her leg does not heal properly. As a temporary solution, they sedated her, splinted her leg, and sent us home with pain medication, instructing us to contact Cider's primary vet to continue the splinting process that we opted for over surgery. That night alone costed us $800 out of pocket.

Fundraiser for new pain relief options,"$10,500 AUD raised","Do you want to join me in making a difference? I'm raising money in aid of Humanitas Trust  and every donation will help. Thank you in advance for your contribution a cause that means so much to me.
 Personally I have had pain issues since my teenage years and in the last 6 years I had grown so sick of it all that I decided to keep trying to find a cure, an answer till I had one.  I had a couple of procedures and a major surgery to try and help and it left me in more pain then I had originally. This increase in pain was diagnosed as complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Some days were worse then others. I was then put on a combination of medications that improved my life but didn’t stop the pain completely.  Sadly these medications made me incredibly tired and my life narrowed down to work and sleep.
 
I missed the little things in life that the pain had taken away like taking the dogs for a walk without having to go home and lie down afterwards, or even being able to do the groceries and some housework on the same day, or being able to sit down comfortably and have dinner with friends and family.  At one stage I was thinking I had to give up on working altogether due to the pain but luckily my specialist talked me out of it.

Then I was referred to Dr Stack and things started to improve again. The day I first tried Dr Stacks medication my entire body was aching and in pain. Within 5 minutes of application of the new medication the local area was the best it had been in years and within 30 minutes 90% of the pain in other areas of my body had gone as well.

McHaley Medical Expenses,"$2,305 raised of $25,000 goal","McHaley is a beautiful spunky 10 year old girl. She lives in Independence, Oregon with her mother Vita Ramos and sister Joel Rodriguez. She is currently in the 4th grade, and attends Ash Creek Elementary School in Monmouth Oregon. McHaley back in November of 2017 was diagnosed with a very rare autoimmune disease called Systemic/ Morphia Scleroderma. It's so rare that fewer than 300,000 people in the world have some form of it, but less than 200 people in the world have her specific variety. The disease is incurable and will eventually result in an early death, but with proper treatment can be managed and her life can be extended. It causes a rapid stiffening and hardening of tissues and organs throughout her body. Because of the rarity of the disease there are no drugs specifically designed to treat it, but there are medications for other illnesses that can be used to ease her symptoms and slow the progression. Unfortunately because these medications were designed (and approved by the FDA) to treat other diseases, most insurances will not pay for them to be used to treat McHaley. We are actively working with her doctors, the hospital, and the drug manufacturers to get these treatments at the most affordable cost possible but they are still quite expensive. This is where you come in. While we hate to even ask, there is no way that we can continue to afford these bills on our own. Please help us extend both the length and quality of McHaley's life, allowing her to live the most normal life possible for a child. On behalf of McHaley's family and friends we would like to thank you all for your love, support, prayers and any donations.

Sheeva next check up and medication,$285 CAD raised,"Hey everyone, most of you know that I have a 9 year old English Bulldog named Sheeva, she was recently diagnosed with Inflammatory Bowel Disease. It almost took her life. She has been on medication for over 2 months now and they really seem to be helping. I've had her on pet insurance since she was a puppy which has definitely come in handy. Her insurance has gone up to a point I can no longer afford, so im hoping to get another month of her coverage so I can buy a few months of her meds before i change the insurance plan which will be more affordable monthly paymenta but will make the deductible higher and they will cover a lower percentage which will cost me more the next time shes sick. So im hoping I can get some help while I have the deductible paid off and the insurance company will cover a higher percentage. So I'm asking for help and im very embarrassed but I've ran out of options and just want the best quality of life for Sheeva, because being a senior Bulldog, I don't know how many more years she has left.

Help Bash with their car and health (Read info!),"$1,545 raised of $2,000 goal","Hello there, My name is Bash Quispe and I need your help.
At the beginning of last winter, I entered a mental crisis that ended up with me being responsible for several burdening factors in my life. One of them being medication that is currently being paid out of pocket and has been necessary to my quality of mind and mental recovery. Another is being responsible for rent of a one bedroom apartment that I am currently struggling to pay for and cannot break the lease due to an absurd charge which I cannot, in any shape or form, can afford. Due to all of this, I cannot afford food since it goes to gas and medication, so I have been relying on food programs to feed me in the meantime. However, I had a functioning car that has been essential to going to and from work, go to food pantries, and began working DoorDash on top of a very physical job in order to afford rent. I spent the last of my savings and credit on this car that has been essential to overcoming my struggle. I believe that through hard work and diligence I would be able to pay for rent and medication until my lease ended so then I can look for an affordable place later this year to make my life easier and focus on repaying back all that I owe to my family and friends who have helped me go through this rough period of my life. I believed that I simply had to go through a bout of endurance and face the consequences of my failure of being responsible of my mental health. However, yesterday morning my car has been unusable due to an unforeseen accident, which now puts my very livelihood at risk.

Matthew's Medical Assistance,"$2,065 raised of $5,000 goal","Hello everyone, as most of you know, Matthew has been diagnosed with Adult T-Cell Lymphoma. Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a rare and often aggressive (fast-growing) T-cell lymphoma that can be found in the blood (leukemia), lymph nodes (lymphoma), skin, or multiple areas of the body. Over the past few months, he has been struggling to not only feel well with little knowledge until now, but also has not been able to work. Even with the diagnosis that was just confirmed the other day, there is still very little information around Adult T-Cell Lymphoma. There are not many statistics around this rare disease, as it is a very rare form of cancer. When speaking with the doctor, he had only 2 options he was given as treatment. 

The first option is to be placed on a medication called Cyclosporine. This is not a cure for this disease but is to regulate/normalize his T-Cells. He has to see his doctor every week for blood work to make sure the medication is working properly and is given the proper dosage that his body needs. This medication costs around $600 dollars (a month) without insurance/pharmacy discounts. With the ability to use a pharmacy discount, after much detailed research and multiple phone calls, the cheapest price that was found is just over $300 dollars (a month). This medication is very rare, and not just sitting on the shelves, it must be ordered which could take 3-7 business days to arrive.

The second option that was given is a very intense/aggressive amount of Chemo treatments for about 4 months. But theres more, after this extensive amount of Chemo, he would then have to go through a procedure to basically have a bone marrow transplant through hiself. In this process, they would collect stem cells from his body and freeze them. After this, they would go into his body, extract all his bone marrow and again give a very intense blast of Chemo to hopefully wipe out any Cancer cells. Then, they would immediately replace his stem sells and bone marrow back into his body to hopefully generate non-cancerous cells. After this procedure, Matthew would be bed-ridden for atleast a month. This treatment is what would be needed to possibly cure the disease, but there are no statistics to how effective this treatment option actually is. 

As you can see, either procedure is very intense and not affordable. The doctor has suggested the medication be the first step we take as it is the cheapest method and he would like to see how the medication takes affect on his body before looking into the long, grueling process of intensive Chemo/Bone-Marrow treatment. 

At this time, we are working hard to find available options for medical assistance that could help out with the cost of either treatments. Without medical insurance, it is extremely difficult. Matthew has been denied for many programs, and continues to look into many other options. This entire process is taking a toll on him not only mentally but physically. With me starting a new job a couple of months ago, I've taken a pay decrease. I have aquired a second job to help with living expenses and medical costs. I have maxed out all credit cards and we're doing everything that we can. We have no other options but to reach out to all of our friends, family, etc.

Thank you to everyone for all you love, support, and any contributions you have provided to him over the past couple of weeks. It has meant a great deal to both of us. As you know, we never ask for anything from everyone, but we are seeking any and all assistance possible. Every dollar contributed will be used for medication every month, medical bills, and Matthews living expenses.

All I ask is that everyone please share this as time is very prescious.

Three Strands Awareness Fund,"$2,770 raised of $1,500 goal","Last spring break, I went on a medical mission trip to Cap-Haïtien, Haiti with the non-profit organization, Three Strands.

For as long as I can remember, I’ve wanted to go into the medical field. Both of my parents, being physicians, have shown me what it truly means to heal and give. When they went to the Central African Republic with Three Strands in 2012, I knew that a trip of that magnitude was something I wanted to participate in as well. The people of Haiti truly inspired me to pursue medicine and philanthropy. With this fund, I want to give back to the people of Haiti who touched my heart throughout this trip, and hopefully be able to heal some of their pain along the way.

This fund, and it's attached promotional video, are the outlets I am using to inform and, perhaps, inspire others. Three Strands is a non-profit organization that works to provide accessible and affordable health care to those who need it. Their drive and passion to care for others comes from the organization being faith-based. Each patient is treated with the appropriate medical care, as well as being treated spiritually through prayer. Haiti has been said to be one of the poorest countries in the world. The World Health Organization has shown that the average Haitian lives off of approximately $2.00 per day. Therefore, Three Strands decided to establish a medical clinic, where those who need medical care, can receive it despite how much money they have. 

The money donated to this fund will be used to purchase the needed medication to restock the Three Strands Cap-Haïtien clinic. The clinic functions year-round and sees many patients who need medication to combat things such as, hypertension, UTIs, STDs, gastroesophageal reflux disease, ear infections, and diabetes. The pharmacy at the clinic, though it is small, has medications that many men, women, and children of Cap-Haïtien desperately need. 

Any and all donations are appreciated and if you would like to get involved directly, you may also visit www.three-strands.org.

Lifting Communities Project,"$3,025 raised of $3,270 goal","I.         The Problem

The community of Las Malvinas, a northern suburb of the capital city of Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic, is a low-income neighborhood where the well-being of local residents is negatively impacted by inadequate health education and poor access to basic health services.


II.       The Goal

The goal of the Lifting Communities project is to empower the people of Las Malvinas to improve their personal well-being by providing basic health, nutrition, and fitness education and improving access to affordable medications.




The project is built on 3 distinct branches, each one leveraging volunteer labor, previous  projects, and donations in-kind to maximize the impact on the community while minimizing the cost. We expect to assist the entire community, approximately 3,400 people, with improved access to affordable medicines, provide basic health education to 320 youths and adults, and provide sports and fitness equipment and training to 120 community members of all ages.





The first branch of the project is to open a public pharmacy. In the Dominican Republic, a public pharmacy or “botica popular” is a very small pharmacy which sells government-subsidized medications.

Photo: Public pharmacy in 2015.

These pharmacies are located in low-income neighborhoods where residents cannot afford the medicines sold in larger pharmacies nor the transportations costs to get there.

Photo: Final concept renders for the public pharmacy by Colectivo Revark.

For the last couple of years, students from the Practivistas program have been working on building an environmentally friendly building to host a public pharmacy. Built with recycled materials and powered by solar-energy, the building is nearly complete but needs a few finishing touches before it can be opened.

Photo: First concept render for the public pharmacy by Colectivo Revark.

Remaining to be completed are such tasks as installing the rainwater catchment system, replacing the water pump, connecting the solar panel to the building’s electrical systems, finishing the floors, and painting. We will also stock the pharmacy with basic office furniture including chairs, a desk, shelves, a cash box, and ledgers for record keeping. These steps must be completed before the building can meet the basic requirements to received government-subsidized medications.



Once the building is completed, the Project Leaders will work together to request the necessary permissions from the government. This process can take a long time and requires regular follow up and visits to government offices. The Project Leaders are better able to procure these permissions on behalf of the community because of greater mobility and government connections.

Photo: Recent photo of the public pharmacy or botica popular. (It now has metal door and window. )

The completion and opening of the public pharmacy was identified as one of the top three needs of the Las Malvinas community at several community meetings. Finalizing this project will bring much needed low-cost medications to a community which otherwise does not have access. (A small side benefit to the project is that, once the permissions are received and the pharmacy can open, the government will pay the salaries of the local community members who will staff the pharmacy, leading to income-generation for a few people.)





The second branch of the project is a series of health education workshops. The younger community members will be split into two groups – 12 to 14 years and 15 to 18 years. Both age groups will have 2 sessions of approximately 45 minutes each. The focus for the 12-14 year age group will be standard personal hygiene as well as basic human reproductive systems education. For the older youths, the topic will be more advanced reproductive health as well as basic nutrition information.

Photo: One of the groups of 25 teenager students currently taking classes in the new Las Malvinas plastic-bottle schoolroom.

The workshops will be held in the local elementary school and will be managed by our Medical Consultant. We expect to reach approximately 160 youths with these workshops and will then train 3-6 young adults (aged 20-30) on how to lead such talks in the future. These workshops will help to give the young people of Las Malvinas the information they need to adopt healthy habits and make informed choices about their bodies, which will help them improve their overall health and well-being.

      

The adult workshops will be for community members aged 19 and above. The focus of these workshops will be nutrition and disease prevention and maintenance. The nutrition portion will include details about basic nutrition as well as nutritional concerns for children and the elderly, all with an eye on meal preparation with a very limited budget and limited access to high quality natural foods. The disease prevention and maintenance portion will focus on both dietary, exercise, and other lifestyle choices which can help prevent and/or mitigate the impact of chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and high blood-pressure.

We expect to reach approximately 160 community members and will then train 3-6 adults (aged 20 and above) on how to lead such talks in the future.

These workshops will help give the adults of Las Malvinas the information they need to use nutrition and healthy lifestyle choices to protect their own health and the health of their dependents.





For the third branch of the Lifting Communities project, we plan to collaborate with fitness communities from all over Santo Domingo. Personal trainers, power lifters, body builders, and fitness enthusiasts of all kinds will be brought together for a few days of community service to guide and inspire the people of Las Malvinas. The first step is to prepare the physical space. Fitness volunteers and residents will work together to pick up trash in the community, focusing on the sports fields, and do some basic field maintenance so the land is ready for play. We will also provide the girls’ volleyball team and the boys’ baseball team with the basic equipment they need to play well and safely.

Studies have shown that participation in sports can result in reduced likelihood of drug use, teenage pregnancy, and other risky behaviors which negatively impact health. We will also provide limited light-weight and easy to use exercise equipment – such as TRX bands – for the adults. This equipment will be held in the Community Center or by a Community Leader and will be available for all to use. Providing adults with simple exercise equipment will enable them to stay active and implement some of the healthy lifestyle choices discussed in the Adults Workshops.



Once we have the space cleaned up, the fitness volunteers will run group exercise classes with the community members to demonstrate how quick and easy (and fun!) exercise can be. Four sessions will be held, each approximately 30 minutes, during which volunteers will lead the community members through a series of body weight resistance training and interval cardio exercises designed to improve the overall fitness of participants. Though we expect to have approximately 30 participants at each session, all community members will be welcome and the number of participants will not be restricted. Similar to the education workshops, we will identify a small number of enthusiastic community members (approximately 3-6, ages 20 years and above) who will be trained on how to lead similar group sessions and basic weight-lifting techniques using body weight and home-made equipment so that these community exercise sessions can continue even after the Lifting Communities project has come to a close. This will create a sustainable opportunity for community members to improve their fitness and overall well-being through regular exercise.



The total budgeted cost of the project is $3,760. We have been promised $490 worth of donations in-kind from community members so the final budget we are requesting is $3,270. Because the project is run entirely on volunteer labor, over 85% is for raw materials, of which $1,200 will be spent on sports equipment for community's youths and $850 will be spent on the water pump that will serve the public pharmacy. The water pump and completion of the public pharmacy represent the largest portion of the budget with 45%, followed by the sports and training which requires 43%, and finally the workshops for the remaining 12%.







The project will be run through Colectivo Revark, a local grassroots NGO dedicated to sustainable community development. Founded in 2010, by ,  y , the organization has participated in projects and workshops in six different countries throughout the Caribbean and Latin America. In 2011, Colectivo Revark began the Practivistas Dominicana Program: a summer immersion program conducted in collaboration with Humbolt State University which brings together American and Dominican students to help communities find sustainable solutions to systemic problems. The Las Malvinas community was chosen as the primary site of the Practivistas program in 2011 and the program has returned there every year since because of the enthusiastic collaboration and profound contributions made by the local residents.

Help us open our low cost spay & neuter clinic!!!,"$5,375 raised of $25,000 goal","Hi there! My name is Dara and I am the co-founder of Celery City Cat Cafe. Our original mission was to open a cat cafe but then Covid-19 popped up and added a detour to our journey.  All events/fundraisers came to a screeching halt. In July of 2020 we responded to a Facebook post about a woman looking for help TNRing a large community cat colony in Sanford, FL.




From August to December of 2020 we were able to TNR 69 (30 from that colony alone!) cats and got 20 kittens in to rescue/foster homes thanks to our rescue partners.  However, we found it hard to find available spay/neuter appointments, even with knowing all the available resources in our area.  At our final board member meeting of the year I brought up the idea of opening a low cost spay/neuter clinic.  There was still an obvious need for more access to affordable spay/neuter services in central Florida and the board agreed!  That's where the idea of




Our clinic will operate as a dba (doing business as) under the non-profit status of the cat cafe while we work on getting the clinic it's own 501c3 status.  To start we will be open three days a week, and will add a fourth if we need to.  We will also offer a wellness clinic for cats and dogs.  Vaccines, microchips, heartworm tests, etc... will be available. The majority of our surgeries will be cats as they have higher euthanasia rates in our local shelters.  However, if a dog needs an emergency spay (pyometra) we will happily and without hesitation help.
  



Opening a spay/neuter/wellness clinic is not an easy or cheap task! We applied for two grants to help offset opening costs and did not receive either, so we are asking you to help us make this  happen! We've purchased as much stuff used as we could but some items can't be bought off Facebook Marketplace :) He are our biggest expenses:

Anesthesia Machine $4,500
Antibiotics $500
Surgical Drugs $1,500
Equipment (ET tubes, centrifuge, scales, etc...) $1,500
Medical Consumables (lots medications, needles, syringes, etc...) $4,000
Surgical Instruments $2,500
Microchips and reader $750
Vaccines $3,000
Flea & heartworm prevention $4,000
Surgical Table $2,500
Exam Table $1,600
Computer/Office supplies $1,500
Licenses/permits $500

and I know there's probably something I forgot!

Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause that will help so many cats and dogs.  If you can't donate today, please share and tag your animal loving friends!  We're so excited to serve our community!!

Donate to help Becky's Battle Against Diabetes,"$2,310 raised of $18,000 goal","Dear Friends and Supporters, my name is Hsiao Lei and I am fundraising to help cover the medical expenses of my dear friend Becky. As someone who has been living with diabetes for many years and finally found a medication (Mounjaro) that works well to keep her A1C and symptom under control. The medical treatments she needs are not covered by insurance and the out-of-pocket costs are more than she can manage on her own.
Becky has been an integral part of a 500 people company cafeteria for over 11 years, providing delicious and nutritious meals that keep everyone going throughout the day. She knows everyone’s name and the food we like. Without the medications, she constantly feels fatigue and tiredness. This has not stopped her from helping others and doing a great job at work. She spends her vacation time to attend church volunteering activities for food drive, cooking for low-income families..

Fighting For Zoey,"$2,800 raised of $2,500 goal","hey guys!!! as most of you know, i regularly collect donations for local animal shelters. over the years, thousands of dollars of items have been distributed to several shelters and organizations, and i have spent countless hours volunteering. i never ask for much for myself, but right now things have really hit home. march 10, 2011, one of my rescues, zoey, was diagnosed with mandibular osteosarcoma. she had an operation called a mandibulectomy, which means half of her lower jaw was removed. two and a half years later, the cancer has returned. she now has several large masses in her chest. they cannot be removed this time around since it has already spread. she is now on a new drug called palladia, which we hope will slow down the spread and growth of the existing masses, and also slow down the formation of newer masses. even with my two full time jobs and several odd jobs, this medication is barely affordable. i am asking if anyone would like to donate to help pay for the cost of the medication, which she will be on indefinitely. i am doing everything i can for my zoey!!! hopefully the medication will give us some more time with my precious girl! thanks guys.

12.10.14 UPDATE: one whole year has gone by since the return of the cancer. the palladia, along with several other drugs/treatments, has helped maintain the size of the tumors. for the most part, the disease has remained stable. this year was not easy; we did have a few bumps and rough patches along the way. but zoey was able to be a part of my wedding day, and she has had an extra year of love and happiness thanks to her family, her doctors, and her amazing support group. i just wanted to say thank you again to everyone who has helped us out thus far. i ask you all to please continue to share this page, share zoey's story, spread the word about my amazing miracle dog, say a prayer, and keep encouraging people to donate to her medical expenses! only 30% of dogs with osteosarcoma live longer than  two years after surgery. zoey has beat the odds and i am ever so grateful and appreciative of every minute i have with her and my entire four legged family.

Help Helena Stay with Her Mom in Hospital,"$5,500 raised of $15,000 goal","One of my dearest friends, Helena Sarinana, needs help. I don’t have the financial means to do it on my own, but together, with the kindness of friends and strangers, I know we can make a huge difference in her life. Please read her story.
  On August 2nd,2021, Helena and her mother, Nelly Banda, traveled to Monterrey Nuevo Leon, Mexico for a spiritual retreat.   Traveling with her was her husband, Richard, and 3 year-old son, Santiago.  
  A few days after arriving in Mexico, the entire group began to get sick. First Helena, then Richard, then her little boy, and finally her mom. Helena and Richard tested positive for Covid on August 9th.  Santiago had a fever that night, going to the next morning. And her mom started with a fever on August 10th.  Of course, this meant they had to quarantine and couldn’t travel back to California. The additional expenses started racking up at this point.

Help Donna Afford Life-Changing Treatment,"$32,515 raised of $35,000 goal","Hi, my name is Bree, and I'm one-half of the dynamic duo behind the author Kit Rocha. My co-writer, Donna Herren, is not just my business partner. She has been my best friend for over 20 years. And she is having a rough time.

In 2019, she was diagnosed with early stage cancer. Surgery and radiation worked wonders, and she was declared cancer free in February 2020. Unfortunately, she was also immuno-compromised heading into March 2020. She was an early victim of covid, and while she avoided hospitlization, the illness was extremely hard on her body. She dealt with long covid for months, and they eventually realized the covid had caused heart damage. But even with treatment over the next few years, she still struggled. All of this resulted in mounting medical bills--and a slow down in the writing that would normally help us pay those bills.

Pay for my heart & lung medications,"$2,355 raised of $9,500 goal","Hi -

My name is Bobby Wayne Freeman.  I'm 60 years old and have  lived in Detroit all of my life.  For several years I did not have health care and like a lot of Americans did not go to a doctor.  I finally got health care through the Affordable Care Act and just in time!  I had to have a pacemaker and a defibrillator implanted in my chest a year ago which has to be monitored and checked every 3 months.

I am now faced with several health issues:  extremely severe C.O.P.D., emphysema, high blood pressure, high cholesteral and a heart condition.  I am on a variety of prescriptions.  The medications the doctors have prescribed for me, which includes Advair HFA, Tudorza Pressair,  Combivent Respimat, Lisinopril, Atorvastatin, Fluticasone Propionate, Metropolol and an Apria Nebulizer breathing machine.  All of which costs me about $928 per month - and those are just the copays.  This does not include all of the medical bills from last year.  This is a staggering amount for someone of my income level. 

I work full time at a metal shop sometimes 6 or 7 days a week and have to wear a hospital mask the entire time due to my respiratory issues.  Because my take home pay is just above the poverty line there is no way I can afford all of my medicenes.  As a result I'm forced not to take some of my prescriptions or I cut the dosages in half.  Because I  still work I don't qualify for a lot of supplemental or financial aid programs - and believe me I've tried, as well as my pharmacist and my family. 

Despite some folks telling me I should quit my job and become more eligible for public assistance that is simply not how my parents raised me.  I'm a father and a grandfather.  I also feel it's my responsiblity to be a good role model to my kids and grandkids who still look up to me.  My philosophy is if I can get out of bed every morning and put on my jeans and boots, I will put in a full day's work. 

Making a public appeal like this for financial help is not something I want to do, but the high cost of my maintenance medications has forced me to do so.  If it is within your heart and your ability, I would greatly appreciate any donation that you can share.

Thank you for taking the time to read my story and God bless you.

Sincerely,

Brother Bob

Help for Niruba's urgent surgery and medication,"$2,441 raised of $5,000 goal","Hello,

This is our plea to get the help that our much beloved Niruba aka, Nirumasi, aka Niru in India. She has lived the most difficult life with a major smile on her face but most importantly carried herself with grace and has an enormous heart. She's the most positive and realistic person ever.

Due to misdiagnosis of -ve COVID, she has been suffering after effects of COVID for 40+ days. She has been battling fungal infection, which has spread to her brain and possibly her eyes.

After multiple doctor consultations, and various challenges of finding the recommended anti-fungal medications we started the medication and prayers. Despite all, the infection has spread and brain surgery is required immediatetely to stop the spread and remove the infection.

Currently, private hospitals are her best bet for the crucial and timely surgery and after care. This option is not affordable for her family.  We are determined to get her the care she deserves. With her mental strength and faith, we know she can make it through this.

Please help us save our masi. No amount is small and every bit will help.

Hope For Larry,"$12,815 raised of $50,000 goal","Our Husker brother is in need of our help. Larry Florence is an alumnus of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln where he played alongside some greats and had 4 successful seasons. Larry played for the Huskers from 1996-2000, and is fifteenth on the all-time scoring list for the Huskers with 1,223 points. Florence also ranks third in Nebraska career starts (105), eighth in games played (123), and seventh in steals (137). He went on to further his basketball career overseas for 8 years (Argentina, Iceland, Chile, Greece, Mexico, Peru) where he was successful as well. After eventually ending his career, he returned home to Phenix City, Alabama where he dedicated his time and skills to teaching physical education and health, coaching middle and high school basketball and hosting affordable basketball camps. At age 37, Larry’s life changed drastically when he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a cancer that forms in a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell. In addition, doctor’s recently found tumors in his back and mouth, which has caused severe dental issues. Over the past 10 years Larry has only been able to work a short 3 months due to constant hospital stays, at least 10 chemo treatments with radiation therapy, over 200 other experimental treatments, and a host of medication trials. Because of this, he has totally lost his income, his house, unable to care for his daughter like he hoped, and his means of transportation. To say he has given life his best fight thus far is an understatement. He has tried all the treatments available to him in the Atlanta/Alabama area. Larry would like to travel to California to see a highly recommended cancer doctor to see if he can provide a life changing treatment to help Larry live longer and in less pain. This fundraiser is to help relief Larry’s many financial burdens due to fighting cancer. We are hoping to raise enough funds to help with the travel (airfare) and room and board expenses to see the specialist in California, living expenses due to not being able to work, gas to and from his frequent treatments, help with purchasing his ever changing medication regime, and a mount of unpaid medical bills. I hope you find in your heart to give whatever you can to help Larry fight for his life. He is so humbled and so deserving of all that life has to offer and we can him ease the burdens as he continues to fight the good fight.

Fund for Kaleb,"$2,564 raised of $3,000 goal","Hi, I'm Kelly and I am raising money to help my son with his bills and living expenses after a hospital stay and illness that has kept him from being able to work. 

As many of you know, Kaleb was diagnosed with Crohn's in 2012, just after he turned 13 years old. He was immediately put on Remicade infusions, (every 7 weeks) which kept him in remission for several years.

In early 2020, his insurance notified him that they would no longer approve the Remicade and that there was a new (cheaper) medication, a bio-similar called Inflectra that he needed to try. After his first infusion of Inflectra, Kaleb began developing upper respiratory infections and strep throat. He had never had either previously and just as soon as they'd cure one, he'd present with the other. He was so sick that he ended up dropping out of college at Eastern Michigan University where he was studying Electrical Engineering. After several months, the insurance finally approved his Remicade again.

Healing Time for Shannon,"$1,235 raised of $4,000 goal","My twin sister Shannon is one of the smartest and most generous people that I know. She is the first to lend a hand, share a meal, or even provide financial support when needed. She works as a Social Worker for a local non-profit, where she works diligently to find safe and affordable housing for unhoused individuals with complex medical needs. She is an advocate for social justice, including LGBTQ rights, food and housing security, and harm reduction efforts. She is the most amazing person that I know.

Shannon has also lived with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) for her whole life. She lives with pain that many of us are fortunate to never experience. Last week she had her second surgery in less than a month; at 29 years old she had a full hip replacement and will need to be off work for at least 6 weeks. This surgery was required because of years of degeneration, and while this will not resolve her pain completely, it will help ease some of her pain and increase her mobility for the upcoming years. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that causes your immune system to attack its own body tissues. For Shannon this includes the joints all over her body, many of which are permanently damaged. There is no cure for RA, but Shannon has had some limited success with a variety of medications, and we are hopeful that newer better medications will be developed to treat and slow the degeneration caused by RA for Shannon and others living with this disorder.

Mudge's Knee Surgery,"$2,805 raised of $3,400 goal","Hello everyone! My name is Karen and this beautiful, majestic creature is Mudge! Mudge is a super happy, quirky, and excited doggy so you can imagine our concern when Mudge started limping out of nowhere. At first, we thought it might've been a thorn that got stuck on her left leg or perhaps she hurt it some other way. We checked frequently for any signs of a wound and we waited for it to get better but it never did. I decided to take her to the vet to check it out and I was informed that Mudge, unfortunately, had her knees popped out of place due to luxating patella and that she may have ligament damage. On July 9th, Mudge was sedated for x-rays and blood work. It took around an hour and I cried all the way home as I waited for her results. I will clarify that luxating patella is not life-threatening but the thought of her being in pain all this time made my heart sink. Apparently, it is very common among smaller dogs. I was referred to multiple surgeons that would give me an estimated price for the surgery.


You're telling me. After talking to many animal hospitals, this was the cheapest I could get it! I was being told by multiple surgeons that her surgery would cost about $3000-$7000 per leg. Every surgeon gave me a different number but this was the cheapest I could find it. The Affordable Animal Hospital in Orange gave me a much lower price for both knees.  Her surgery date is scheduled for

I began this fundraiser to cover the costs of Mudge's x-rays, blood work, consultation fees, pain medication, joint medication, the surgery itself, and various other charges that the two animal hospitals have given me/will give me. I will be on a payment plan with the Affordable Animal Hospital because this is a surgery I want to deal with as soon as possible. However, being out $4000 is not an easy position to be in. I would love any help people would be willing to offer me, no matter how small because I would pay anything for my baby rat. 

This is still a rough estimate so if there is any excess money, it will be donated to a local animal shelter!

Affordable Pet Care Coming To an End,"$1,400 raised of $25,000 goal","Tail Waggers 1990 is a 501 (c)(3) non profit organization located in Livonia and Romeo, Michigan. Because of our commitment to animals over the past 35 years and the 37,000 animals that have walked through our doors in the last 14 years, we are now telling our story to humbly ask for financial assistance from pet lovers and supporters, so we can continue moving forward and helping even more animals for years to come.

Starting in a garage handing out pet food to those struggling to feed their animals, and conducting low-cost vaccination clinics in multiple communities, allowed us to hear stories of real people who needed help for their animals, but couldn't find it. With eyes closed and taking a leap of faith, in 2011 Tail Waggers opened their first store-front to hand out pet food and provide booster vaccines for those who attended our low-cost clinics. Suddenly, this unique concept of feeding and vaccinating animals at a reduced cost became an invaluable resource for pet owners who would not otherwise be able to afford these services.

The PhyR Project,"$9,210 raised of $25,000 goal","Update - 01/27/2021

The full update is long, so here is a bullet point summary:

~ We have successfully produced functional insulin and C-peptide using Physarum polycephalum. We have also designed a device that, with more development, could allow people to produce their own safe, functional insulin at home.

~ We have discovered that dysfunction in the traditional medication commercialization process and market structure is to blame for high medication prices, especially insulin.

~ Introducing our PhyR technology to the market via the traditional route would have little to no effect on insulin prices because manufacturing costs are not the problem. Instead, we have created a new and somewhat radical solution that is achievable by individuals or a small group with few resources and could produce effective, very low cost insulin.

~ We are hesitant to proceed with the new solution because it's unclear if people want it. For that reason, we have published our work, technology, and plans here (in the information packet link below) so anyone who wants to use it can, and so we can get feedback from you.

~ Please message or email me feedback on our research and technology; we would like to hear your opinions on if the solution we've proposed could be helpful and viable.


Dear supporters,

Thank you so much for your continuing generosity and encouragement. You’ve helped sustain this project for almost two years even in the midst of struggles brought on by a global pandemic. I cannot express how grateful I am for you and how I respect your strength.

During these last two years, I and several volunteers and team members have put your donations to work in developing the theoretical technology I described in April of 2019. We have had the opportunity to present the technology many times across the country and even internationally, including events at Brigham Young University, the University of Utah, the National University of Singapore, and with many groups of individual supporters. It seems like we’re met with almost overwhelming encouragement and support everywhere we mention the goals of this project. Nearly everyone I’ve personally encountered believes that medication and care are too expensive and that change is necessary in the American healthcare system, especially for those with diabetes.

The goal of The PhyR Project has always been to develop innovative technology with the intention of driving down the cost of insulin and providing the other necessary proteins that current insulin lacks. I am ecstatic to tell you that we have successfully produced insulin and those other proteins using Physarum polycephalum and we have designed a system (the PhyR machine) capable of capturing, purifying, and preparing that insulin for use in the human body to treat type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Even more excitingly, the system we have designed could potentially be used by an individual to produce their own insulin at home, affordably, and independent of insurance and pharmaceutical companies. This system requires more extensive development before it can be trusted to produce insulin safely and reliably at home, but we have proven that it is possible.

While developing this technology, we also dedicated significant time and resources to determining what has gone wrong in the US healthcare system to allow insulin and other medications to cost so much. We found what we believe is the answer and published our analysis in our presentation packet for the University of Utah’s Bench to Bedside program. The packet is included below for public access and I encourage anyone interested to read it carefully; it contains the sum of our work and research over the last two years. In short, we discovered that manufacturing costs have little to no relation to insulin list prices. From section 2.2.3 of the packet:

“...assume a technological advancement reduced the cost of producing, purifying, validating, and packaging insulin by half ($15 per vial). Implementation of that advancement would reduce the list price of insulin from $275 per vial to $260 per vial. If a similar advancement reduced the manufacturing cost to a tenth of the original ($3 per vial), it would lower the list price to $248. If it was reduced to one hundredth of the original cost ($0.3 per vial), the price would be lowered to $245.75. Finally, if it was somehow possible to produce, purify, validate, and package insulin with no manufacturing costs whatsoever, the consumer would still pay $245.45 for a single vial of insulin in the current system. As the system currently exists, no degree of innovation will have any power to significantly reduce the cost of insulin or most other therapeutic drugs because manufacturing cost contributes so little to the actual price the consumer pays.”

As you know, the PhyR technology we’ve been developing is a manufacturing innovation that could significantly reduce the cost of making insulin. Unfortunately, as the above excerpt details, we cannot significantly affect the list price of insulin through manufacturing innovation because the price is being driven up by other factors.

Factors and companies that directly inflate the list price of insulin are discussed in detail in section 2.2.3. Those factors and organizations are important to know about, but we were far more interested in a different question: Why do these companies have the power to inflate list prices at all? This power to affect prices is called market power, and in healthy capitalistic markets, manufacturers and distributors have very little to no market power; they simply have to price the product just above the cost of production and distribution to remain competitive, but still make a profit. In the US healthcare industry, however, manufacturers, distributors, and other groups seem to have an unhealthy and unnatural ability to drive up list prices. My team discovered that this “artificial market power” is apparently due to constraints and stimulation placed on the market by government and regulatory agencies, such as extreme barriers to entry, the plethora of market exclusivity programs provided to manufacturers by the FDA, legislation (like the BPCI Act), etc. This artificial market power cultivates “dysfunctional capitalism” where value is not spread across all parties evenly as in healthy capitalism, but instead corporations leverage their artificial market power and the patient’s need for the product to facilitate a backwards flow of value from the consumer to themselves.

For insulin specifically, you are all intimately aware of the devastating price gouging that has gotten steadily worse over the years. You may not know that a solution to the insulin crisis called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (the BPCI Act) of 2009 was proposed and set into effect over a decade ago. Unfortunately, this helpful and extremely necessary solution ultimately made the situation exponentially worse because of its execution. This legislation was intended to reduce the price of insulin and other drugs not by mandating a cap, but by allowing competing companies to more easily enter the market and produce generic insulin. Essentially, this would’ve set the market right by removing some of the artificial power of the three incumbent companies and, eventually, forcing all companies involved to compete using low prices and high quality. Instead, probably due to lobbying, this bill was altered to include a ten year delay before going into effect for insulin, which has ensured absolute market exclusivity for the three current manufacturers over the past decade. That artificially mandated exclusivity has given those companies and their supply chain partners the ability to drive insulin prices up significantly further than they were even in 2009 when this was already a crisis.

As for what this means moving forward, there’s good news, bad news, and worse news. The good news is that the ten year delay ended on March 23rd of last year (2020), so competition will very likely be entering the market before the end of this year (2021). Competition will certainly reduce prices, but the bad news is that it will probably take time. The worse news is that it’s unclear how much the price will drop even years from now. The BPCI Act only removed one aspect of the artificial market power present in the system; even after competition enters, the market will still be subject to the same constraints and stimulation that plague the rest of the healthcare system. So we’re very hopeful that the situation will improve dramatically, but similar issues will continue to hold the price of insulin and other medications higher than they should be.

So what does all of this mean for the PhyR Project? When we learned that our manufacturing technology couldn’t fix the problem, we hoped that our in-home device powered by the PhyR technology could. Unfortunately, that solution was met with even more regulatory challenges because it would be located in the home and the insulin produced would contain C-peptide (the main protein required to repair damage caused by T1D), which has never been done commercially before. Additionally, we would still need to engage with insurance companies and distributors after getting FDA approval, all of which would drive up the cost just like it has in the current system. In the end, we saw three terrible options: 1) start a company that would end up overcharging for insulin just like the current manufacturers, 2) license the technology to an established company so they can overcharge for insulin like the current manufacturers, or 3) walk away. As you can imagine, that was a very frustrating position to be in after working for so long and actually succeeding with the technology. Still, we couldn’t imagine how much more frustrating it must be for you, the ones subject to such an unjust medical system. That thought motivated us to completely eliminate all three of the above as options and begin searching for a new one.

I do not take the following lightly. Believe me when I say that my team searched for months on end and looked at the problems from every angle possible to us. We found many promising solutions, most involving drastic acts by congress or the use of millions or even billions of dollars, but we only found one solution that could possibly be achieved right now by a few college students. We do understand the gravity of our proposal. As you read, keep in mind the desperate situation that is the American healthcare system. From section 2.3 of the packet:

“With that reasoning and the entire preceding analysis in mind, we propose a radical solution to both the insulin crisis and the problems facing the United States healthcare system at large. Our analysis suggests that the high costs of medication are due to artificial market influences and a dysfunctional capitalistic system that result in the consumer often having only two options: Pay an artificially high price or die. Our solution is the introduction of a third option: Non-government regulated, low-cost medication. In this case, insulin.

“We acknowledge the importance of safety and efficacy regulations, especially for the therapeutic drug industry. We do not propose the abolishment of the current regulatory system; indeed, such a change would probably be impossible in the current system for the reasons discussed above. With those points in mind, we know we need a solution that does not depend on cooperation from either regulatory agencies (those introducing artificial market power) or current pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution companies (those organizations exhibiting dysfunctional capitalistic behavior). However, we also know that it is illegal to distribute non-FDA approved medications. Finally and most importantly, we are aware of the absolute necessity to uphold efficacy and safety standards even without FDA approval. 

“By virtue of our technology, we find ourselves in a unique position to offer a solution which fulfills all of the above issues: our point-of-care production device. Though we had previously proposed labelling it as a drug and/or medical device, we realized that a group with access to similar technology could make a simple change in marketing that would eliminate the need for FDA approval, namely removal of the claim that the insulin produced is injectable. As such, theoretically, the device could be labelled as “For research purposes only,” but include a guarantee that all insulin produced by it would be completely bioactive and have the exact same identity as natural human insulin (with stabilizing excipients matching those found in injectable formulations) or humanized insulin analogues (humanized by the addition of C-peptide). If a company had access to technology similar to ours and did this, they could potentially legally provide one or more of these devices and regular services to any group or individual who purchased them. Likewise, the group or individual purchasing the device could utilize it for whatever personal purposes they want or need to fulfill. This would provide a third option to consumers: Pay an enormous price, die, or purchase a research device and produce their own medication. 

“We believe that the current United States healthcare system removes the basic human right to choose in some situations in favor of maintaining a dysfunctional capitalistic market. More specifically, we believe that each individual has a right to choose an alternative to the current options—poverty or death—even if that alternative presents some level of uncertainty and risk due to lack of government regulation. We also believe that the existence of another option may facilitate some rectification of the current dysfunctional capitalistic system with regard to the distribution of value. Finally, we are confident that the hypothetical solution proposed above would provide an adequate alternative option in addition to several other specific benefits, such as improved overall health and medical independence even in the face of a chronic illness.”

Obviously, we received very mixed reactions when we presented this at the University of Utah. One judge anonymously said this:

“I am completely bothered by the (lack of) ethics in this team. The team proposes to circumvent the huge cost of obtaining FDA approval by selling this equipment ""for research purposes."" However, their plan is actually to sell the equipment for individual diabetic patient production and use of insulin as a drug. The drug is being produced by a novel pathway, which absolutely requires FDA approval before patient use. I am appalled by the plans proposed here, even though I am completely sympathetic with the plight of diabetics and oligopolistic insulin pricing.”

Another judge said quite the opposite:

“I am ""blown away"" by this project, which represents True* Innovation both in the product itself and in the way this team views capitalism and the desperate need for it to evolve past its current dysfunctional state. I am sad that current COVID and other realities of our world and our state will not permit me to convey my admiration and respect for this team face to face. I hope this team receives all support that B2B can provide. *As opposed to what's often portrayed as 'innovation', but in reality is anything but that.”

It’s important for me to note that we have not pursued this further since the Bench to Bedside program in late September. We did not receive the support we needed from the University of Utah and the negative comments, while equal in mass (but not volume) to the positive comments, made us concerned that this radical solution may not be well accepted or even needed.

Moving forward, we want to publicly release all our research and the information necessary to replicate the PhyR technology and device so any individual can utilize it if they want (this release is in the form of the packet below). We are maintaining control of the IP to restrict large corporations from using it, but we want everyone else to have access to the technology if they can use it to help themselves or anyone else, so we are offering free licenses to anyone interested. If you have any questions about that, or if you need information that you can’t find in the system description in the packet (e.g. specific system pressure, reagent concentrations, media composition, etc.), please email me directly at connor.d.behr at gmail.com.

Due to uncertainty, I have disbanded my team for the time being. It's unclear if our solution would even be acceptable to those it's intended to help. I stand at your service with my limited resources, but I also plan to experiment with a variation of the PhyR technology in the chemical manufacturing industry to keep both my family and the technology afloat in the meantime. Again, please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions or comments; my email is above.

I cannot express the depth of my appreciation for you and your support through this journey. I hope this is not the last update I post to this campaign. If it is, I hope wholeheartedly that our work over the last two years has helped.

With deepest gratitude and sincerity,
Connor Behr and The PhyR Project Team

Hi, I’m Connor Behr. If you are or know someone who is diabetic, you may know of the current insulin crisis in the United States and other countries. There are currently only three insulin manufacturers serving the U.S. market: Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi. These suppliers are struggling to keep up with the increasing demand from the growing number of type 1 and type 2 diabetes cases.

According to an published by the American Diabetes Association, there were 30.3 million Americans, 9.4% of the population, with diabetes in 2015. 1.5 million more people are diagnosed every year in America alone. As the three insulin manufacturers attempt to supply these demands, insurance and insulin prices steadily go up. Those who can't pay the increasing rates often need to turn to friends and family for financial aid in order to get what they need to survive. A quick search on GoFundMe for fundraisers with the word ""insulin"" yields nearly 6,500 results, most of which are raising money for insulin and insulin pumps. Still worse, a   conducted by Yale last year found that 25% of diabetic patients were using less insulin than is healthy in order to save money.

I learned of the insulin crisis late last year as my family discussed it while my wife and I were visiting. My sister is type 1 diabetic, so this topic is close to home. When I did more research and the seriousness of the issue became more clear, I decided to apply my skills and try for a solution. I am currently a student at BYU Pathways in pursuit of a degree in molecular biology, which I have loved and studied since I was about 12 years old. I am skilled in the field and have experience shadowing at ARUP Laboratories and a summer internship at the Huntsman Cancer Institute. I received the Emperor Science Award in 2017 for my research in cancer development and treatment and I have conducted related gene and protein expression projects on my own.

After months of hard work, I have completed plans for a method of synthetic insulin production that, if it works, will decrease the cost of insulin by several times and increase production speed and efficiency. We call it the PhyR Project, short for Physarum Reactor. With proper funding for testing and development, this patent-pending method will hopefully reduce insulin costs and insurance costs across the board and create a production rate rapid enough to meet demands with ease. Additionally, this production technique is an almost exact duplicate of the method used by the human body and the resulting insulin solution should be indistinguishable from the insulin solution secreted by our pancreatic beta cells. This means that some symptoms and health problems that diabetics experience may be reversed and they will have more control over their blood sugar levels (this will be discussed in the science section). Finally, this method is intended to eventually make it possible for patients to produce insulin in their own homes.

I have been putting time and resources into this project for months, but with my wife and I both being in school, money is tight and funds for this project are slow to come. I want to work on this problem full-time in hopes of finding a solution as soon as possible for my sister and all others suffering, so if we meet our goal, that's exactly where the funds will go. If the goal is not met, I will still work as much as I can on the project and finish it as soon as I can, but I'm afraid it will take much longer. That's why I came here. I will outline the entire project below, answer any questions, and keep everyone updated so you know what your contributions are doing and how you're helping. Please help if you can; we are very grateful for any donations. Remember, we're trying to help people spend less money and be more healthy, so please don't go out of your budget to donate; we recommend donations anywhere from $1 to $100. And if your budget doesn't allow it, sharing this page is the next best way to contribute and is also greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for reading!


The Science:

In this section, I will explain how the new insulin production method works. This method is patent pending, therefore I can safely disclose all information about it and answer any questions, so please ask. Since this is a pretty scientifically comprehensive description, it might be difficult to understand. Again, please ask questions. You can comment or contact me directly at connor.d.behr at gmail.com. We are also working on a video that should be a little less like trudging through honey, so that will be coming soon.

First of all, it’s important to understand how insulin is naturally produced in the human body. Insulin comes from the pancreas and is produced by specialized cells called beta cells. These cells first transcribe the insulin gene into RNA, which travels out of the nucleus and to something called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is where some proteins are processed and sent to other places in the cell. Here, the RNA is translated into a protein that’s called preproinsulin, but at this stage the insulin is immature and unusable, so it needs to be processed. The preproinsulin is put into the endoplasmic reticulum and folded, then the beginning of the sequence is trimmed off to produce proinsulin. The proinsulin then gets sent to another place in the cell called the golgi apparatus, which is the part of the cell that secretes proteins (sends them outside the cell). Here, the proinsulin is loaded into storage bubbles called secretory vesicles.

At the same time as this is happening to the insulin, the cell is also producing three other proteins named PC1, PC2, and CPE. These proteins take the same route as the insulin, so the golgi apparatus puts them into the secretory vesicles (the storage bubbles) with the proinsulin. Here, the PC1, PC2, and CPE proteins cut and trim the proinsulin into three different pieces, called the A chain, the C-peptide, and the B chain. The A chain and B chain were folded over each other and bound together back when the protein got processed in the endoplasmic reticulum, so those pieces stay together. That’s what mature, usable insulin is--the A and B chains linked together in the middle, but snipped on the ends.

This image from   is a good visual for the process we’re talking about:



So the insulin protein you get looks like this (image credit:  ):



Now that the insulin is mature and active, it is ready to be used. When the beta cells detect high blood glucose levels, they release the secretory vesicles filled with insulin, the C-peptide, PC1, PC2, and CPE into the blood. The insulin goes on to enable other cells in the body to absorb and use the sugar in the blood, but we don’t really know if the other four proteins have functions. Some scientists have theorized that these proteins do have other purposes in the body, especially C-peptide. published by Oxford Academic discusses strong evidence that C-peptide replacement therapy may prevent the complications related to blood vessels that many diabetics experience, such as vascular inflammation, endothelial cell death, and neointima formation. The authors also go on to discuss organ-specific complications that may be treated by C-peptide supplementation, such as retinopathy (damage to eyes), nephropathy (issues with kidney function), neuropathy (nerve damage and pain), impaired wound healing, and inflammation. The paper also mentions improved blood sugar control and stability when insulin and C-peptide are used together. There are strong indications that C-peptide and the other proteins secreted alongside insulin may have other functions in the body, which would explain some of the symptoms that diabetic patients experience, especially type 1. Just like how high blood sugar is caused by the pancreas not producing insulin in type 1 diabetes, other symptoms of diabetes may be caused by the pancreas not producing the other four proteins.

Now that you understand how insulin is naturally produced, let’s briefly cover how synthetic insulin is produced. First, the DNA sequence of the A chain and B chain of insulin are separated and inserted into bacteria or yeast because they are easy to grow. These bacteria or yeast are then put into large metal containers called bioreactors or fermentors. These bioreactors contain media (food) for the microorganisms and systems that maintain the temperature, oxygenation, and movement of the liquid at optimum levels. As the bacteria or yeast grow, they transcribe and translate the DNA put into them encoding the A chain and B chain of insulin. These proteins are produced separately and the bacteria cannot bind them together because they lack an endoplasmic reticulum (yeast do have endoplasmic reticuli, but the binding step is still done by the scientists as part of purification). Once the bacteria or yeast have grown as much as they can in the bioreactor, the tank is drained and the microorganisms are split open, spilling their contents, including the A and B chains (this requires each consecutive batch to be restarted and regrown). After that, the A and B chains are purified out of the liquid, then are chemically treated to bind them together in the middle. Finally, the completed insulin is purified once again, quality tested, and put into glass bottles that are then sold to customers and distributors.

Alright, first of all congratulations on getting this far, four paragraphs of raw science is quite the feat! Give yourself a pat on the back, take five, get a snack, do you.

Now, let’s get to the good stuff. The project we’re proposing uses an organism called Physarum polycephalum to produce insulin in the same way as the human body does. Physarum polycephalum is critical to this method because of its unique properties. It is a multinucleated single celled organism, which means that it’s one massive cell with millions of nuclei. It’s biologically immortal (which means it won’t die of old age) and will continue to grow exponentially as long as it has room, food, and water. It is also eukaryotic, which means it has endoplasmic reticuli (lots, actually). Most importantly of all, however, is that Physarum’s ability to grow so quickly is due to its amount of nuclei, ribosomes (proteins in the cell that translate RNA into protein), and other cellular machinery. It is literally a protein producing machine. As a result, it’s the perfect candidate to produce synthetic insulin quickly and efficiently.

To achieve this, Physarum polycephalum will be modified with DNA encoding human preproinsulin and PC1, PC2, and CPE to process it into insulin with the same method as the human body. Each of the millions of Physarum nuclei will mass produce preproinsulin RNA which will be transported to the millions of endoplasmic reticuli where they will be trimmed, folded and bound, then transported to the millions of golgi apparatus where they will be packaged into secretory vesicles along with PC1, PC2, and CPE where they will be processed into mature insulin proteins, then secreted as insulin, C-peptide, PC1, PC2, and CPE, just as in the human body, but on a much larger, faster, more efficient scale.

Physarum polycephalum specimens that have been modified to do this will be grown normally and rinsed occasionally to harvest the secreted proteins, then the solution will be purified and should be ready for use.

Using this method will reduce the time, energy, cost, and materials required to produce insulin. It does so by eliminating a purification step and the chemical binding step necessary in other techniques, as well as producing the proteins in a more efficient organism system to begin with. This system also does not require every batch to be started from scratch, but instead is continuously producing as needed. This method will also produce the other proteins naturally released in the human body alongside insulin, which may help treat other symptoms of diabetes as well.

Great job, you made it! Thanks again for reading and please ask any questions you have!

Also, please share this if you like what we're trying to do! :)

Thank you so much to everyone who has donated already! The PhyR Project made the front page of the Daily Herald today; click here to see the article. More to come!


Update - 04/19/2019
Thank you all for the continuing support! Check out the latest article on ABC 4 News that aired last night and was published this morning! We still have a long way to go, but we can do it!


Update - 05/23/2019
Just a quick update for those of you who are interested or seeing this for the first time: Thank you to everyone who has donated! You've allowed me to begin modifying Physarum and start building the PhyR machine! I'm still waiting on some samples to get shipped (I want to show you all the reagents and samples so you know how your contributions are helping), but we are less than a few weeks out from that. As you know, we still have a long way to go, but I'm confident that we can do this!

Also, thank you to everyone who came to the T1 International meetings in Salt Lake City and Brigham City this month. I was shocked by your support and hope for this project. We always knew we were out to save lives, but it's more real when those lives start cheering you on.

More coming soon! Thank you!!!


Update - 06/10/2019
Big news! I've been chosen to speak at TEDxSaltLakeCity about the insulin crisis and the PhyR Project! The event will be on September 21st at Kingsbury Hall in Salt Lake. We'd love to see you there! Check it out:

As usual, thank you so much for all the support!


Update - 09/23/2019
TEDxSaltLakeCity was amazing! I'm overwhelmed by the support and love from all of you! It was a wonderful opportunity, and I'm truly in awe of the people I got to work with. So much good!

I was really hoping that the video of the talk would be ready in a few days, but it sounds like it might take a few months for them to release it... I'm excited for everyone who wasn't there to be able to see it as soon as possible though! 

The comments section made me cry earlier today. I'm so grateful for your hope and faith in me and in this project. I cannot thank you all enough.

Your donations are invaluable! So much progress has been made! Anyone who has seen my talk may recognize this image:


I'm so happy to tell you guys that this Physarum specimen is now producing some form of insulin!!! I'm in the process of running a lot more tests to see if the insulin is fully developed or only partially, but I'll keep you posted! Essentially, we know it's expressing the DNA I put into it, so now we just need to find out if it's making the proteins exactly the right way, or if I need to do a little more fine tuning.

These last few months have had several major breakthroughs and we're now this much closer to creating a specimen that produces perfect insulin, then assembling the first PhyR machine prototype! Obviously so much more work has to be done and many more resources are needed, but we're doing it! Again, I cannot thank you guys enough for the donations, shares, support, love, and faith! This is possible only because of you and everything you do.  I can't do this alone. So thank you thank you thank you!!! More updates to come! As always, if any of you have questions or want to hear the details, I'm always so down to talk about any of this.


Update - 06/17/20
We're still alive! Since last fall, the PhyR Project has won various awards in competitions at Brigham Young University, and Physarum and I were featured in an article the Utah Business Magazine!
Read the article here:

We've kept up progress in our protein expression as well, and are several iterations along in the prototyping of the PhyR machine. Thank you all so much--this is only possible because of your continued support! More soon, and as always, feel free to reach out!

Medical Protective Equipment Rapid Response,"$13,285 raised of $50,000 goal","Right now there is a massive shortage in Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for medical, emergency, and first responder personnel because of the global outbreak of COVID-19. Traditional supply cannot meet this accelerated demand. This new reality requires new solutions.

No longer can we wait for what we need. We need to use what we have to help save lives. We have a responsibility to step up and help however we can.


These Chicago startups and innovators made up of current consumer products, design & innovation firms, and ex-Motorola engineers, have joined together to build off-the-shelf solutions for those on the front-line of this pandemic. Using readily-available materials combined with affordable 3D-printed components, medical and emergency workers will have a new path to access face shields, masks, and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR).

Design, development, and testing phases are complete. Now, we just need your help to secure the raw materials and components to turn these prototypes into life-saving devices.

Join us in helping to ensure new protective equipment is made available to those who need it most. Give to the PPE Rapid Response and help our Chicago startups move even faster.







Our hospital staff members are our frontline workers. If hospital staff contract the virus, they are required to stay home and not work for 14 days and show no symptoms for 3 days without medication. And that’s the *best-case* scenario.

We must protect these workers and the capacity they provide at our hospitals.

With a shortage of standard medical personal protective equipment, doctors and nurses are forced to re-use or forego materials that would otherwise protect them from the virus.

In order to get new equipment, manufacturers need to gather the materials, make the supplies, package them up, put them on a truck that puts them on a boat or a plane that puts them on another truck that takes them to a hub where another truck takes them to hospitals. We don’t have time for all that.

Our frontline workers need protective equipment NOW.




We are a group of Chicago makers, entrepreneurs, innovators, inventors, engineers, and designers, who saw a need and stepped up to fill it. We decided to refocus our efforts and donate our time and workforce to design and prototype solutions.

As part of the larger   (Chicago Proactive Response) lead by innovation centers mHUB, MATTER, and 1871, this group is focused on PPE and the maker community. We're all working toward the same goal, and we find that working together gets us better results.




We are decentralizing this complex and time-consuming process by innovating new solutions using existing materials. By using off-the-shelf products with a few small 3D-printed components we are enabling people to build their own solutions for a fraction of the cost.

Our team of engineers, designers, and logistics professionals have paused their commercial initiatives to put resources toward solving this problem. After consulting local doctors and medical professionals around the world, we have focused our teams' efforts on developing real solutions.




The team from   has designed and developed protective face shields that are comfortable, adjustable, interchangeable, and available at a mere fraction of the cost of existing solutions. Using a 3D printed frame, readily-available 1” elastic bands, and 8.5”x11” transparency sheets, this tool-less design uses a standard 3-hole punch to align the transparency sheets to the frame and create a face mask in seconds.


The PAPR project team from   and , have worked together to create a prototype for a Powered Air-Purifying Respirator (PAPR) using a diving mask, custom 3D-printed adapters, standard hoses, and a battery-powered filter box from off-the-shelf components. Easy to sanitize and adjust, it’s even easier to procure.


The team at   is building and manufacturing a shippable low-cost protective face shield. They have developed a rapid manufacturing process that will allow for up to 100,000 shields to be made per week. 

The team at  , in coordination with Northwestern University's Department of Computer Science, has created an online exchange for critical medical devices and supplies. This makes it easier for those who have resources to connect with those that desperately need them.




•
If you have to wait 6 weeks in order to build the tools to manufacture new devices, we have taken too much time.

•
With minimal shipping of parts needed and 3D print files shared digitally, these materials can be made anywhere in the world.

•
As we learn how these products are used, we can continually improve the design and the operational sourcing of the components.

•
The cheaper this equipment is, the more we can provide to medical professionals around the world.




We are creating an independent non-profit wing to manage and distribute the funds. 

We will purchase individual components like hoses, pumps, and filters, as well as activate 3D printing facilities to print the custom components needed. Spinning up a typical manufacturing facility takes herculean effort, but with our experience and planning, we're able to start immediately once funds are received.

If we reach our goal of $250k, $100k will be used to get materials to build ~20,000 facemasks, $150k to get materials to build ~750 PAPR systems, all to be distributed at cost locally and shared open source with others to build locally as well.

Even without reaching our goal, this money will go to use immediately:

At $10k we plan to deliver 2,000 facemasks, at $20k, we plan to deliver the first 100 PAPRs, and at $100k we plan to deliver another 5,000 facemasks and another 250 PAPRs. More updates to follow.

Our primary goal is to move fast and get materials into the hands of those that need them sooner rather than later. Our first milestone is $10k.

Toro’s Leg Surgery,"$2,115 raised of $3,500 goal","We’d like to introduce you to our dog, Toro. Toro is 5 years old and has been with our family for the last 4 years at which time he’s quickly become our best friend and a very important part of our lives. Toro came into our family when a friend posted the photo you see above, asking if anyone would be willing to take in a puppy. The photo of Toro as a pup immediately swayed my family into adopting him and bringing him home to stay with us. Throughout the years, he’s brought us so much love, joy, and excitement. After losing our last dog so suddenly, Toro really has helped us feel the love and bond that we all look for in our pets. Recently: Toro has not been doing well. About a month or so ago, we noticed that he was having trouble getting up from laying or sitting down. His hind legs didn’t seem to be working like they normally would and he eventually developed a limp once he was finally able to get up to stand or walk. It got worse after a couple of days so we immediately decided to take him to his vet where they ran various tests and took various images of his hip and legs. After the doctors evaluation, they discovered that Toro had a cruciate tear in his right hind leg. This is equivalent to a person tearing their ACL which is incredibly dangerous and painful. We’re still unsure about when or how this happened, unfortunately. As the days progressed, so did Toro’s limp and the pain in his leg. He continued to struggle getting up off the floor. My family decided to research the surgery and other treatment options, but the only reasonable and effective option is to operate on his leg. In doing research, we came into contact with several possible veterinarian surgeons and quickly learned how tedious and expensive a surgery like this can be (recovery time alone is about 4 months). After a few days of research, we were able to find an affordable doctor in San Diego who has agreed to operate on Toro in mid-April. Although this is the most affordable doctor we’ve found, it’s still incredibly difficult for us to raise within a month. The longer we wait to operate, the higher the chances of Toro developing arthritis are. Toro is a young and relatively healthy dog who deserves to live a long comfortable life. We understand that times are more difficult now than ever, but any donations would be greatly appreciated! These donations would go entirely towards surgery and post-surgery costs which include blood work and medication. You can learn more about soft tissue surgery online if you search “cruciate tear surgery” or you can reach out to us for more information.

Yvonne & Bitsy Need Your Help,"$5,365 raised of $6,000 goal","I've been working with Yvonne for 2 years now as one of my Living/Dying Clients. The sessions we have together are volunteer-based & support her emotional, physical and spiritual healing. While I've been able to offer Yvonne a level of guidance in navigating some of life's difficulties, she has been in a very unfortunate financial situation. With a fixed retirement income, significant unexpected medical expenses, and excessively long waits for the senior assisted living options she's continuously following up with, I thought helping her launch a GoFundMe might be helpful.
Yvonne is an amazingly caring individual with a beautiful heart. As an older woman with no family in the area or immediate help availible, she is hoping a compassionate community might come to her aid in this difficult time.

Please help my Momma,"$5,255 raised of $7,200 goal","My name is Gabe, and for those of you that don’t know my Momma you are missing out. For those of you that do, you know that she gives all the love inside her heart to everyone she meets. She never says “No”, even if it drains her completely. So my Momma has had rheumatoid arthritis since she was about 19 years old. Medication matching for people with that disease is a difficult and draining journey and it has taken its toll on her. My Momma finally found one that her body likes, but her insurance stopped allowing supplemental aid to cover it. They have up’d her out of pocket expense to $1800 for a one month supply! If we give her a few months, she’ll be able to find something new and more affordable, hopefully. She’s already gone a one month without it and it’s hurting her little body.

Help Ellie Get Her Hyperthyroidism Treatment!!,"$3,082 raised of $3,000 goal","1. PREFACE
2. THE SITUATION
3. THE BACKSTORY
4. THE AMAZING PURR (Ellie says ""Thank You!""):
______________________________

1. PREFACE:  Let me start by saying that I know the pandemic is hurting *EVERYONE* right now, & I send much love to you for just reading my story.  Every little bit will absolutely help, & if you CAN afford to donate, even just a small amount, it would be so very, very much appreciated.

  Ellie was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism earlier this year. We've gone the medication route so far because it's the most affordable off the bat, BUT doing only meds usually stills allows significant organ damage & a much shorter lifespan. We started at a higher dose, but then needed to reduce it because it was tipping her over into hypothyroidism. I still worry, though, because, she is super thin, always seems hungry (even though I feed her 3x/day, more than my other, younger, more active cat Lentil), and has experienced vomiting and nausea despite the medication.  So I want to get her , which has a 95% curative rate; does not damage other organs; allows for a longer, healthier lifespan; and is cost-equivalent to meds in the long run -- the problem is it's a bulk sum all needed at once.

First, RadioCat (the clinic that does the therapy), requires from my vet:
- A blood panel
- Urinalysis
- A chest x-ray
- An up-to-date rabies shot
Which will cost approximately .

Then, the actual treatment itself costs .

I just found out that the clinic requires tests from my local vet at 1 month & 3 months after treatment, which will cost $300+ for each visit, AND they/the state of California requires that I use clumpable, flushable litter for her (because apparently, putting potentially radioactive material in the water system is preferable over putting it in the garbage??) for a period of at least 2 weeks -- and that stuff ain't cheap!! So, unfortunately, I've needed to raise the fundraising total to accommodate this, adding to cover those costs as well.

As a person on disability, even just the treatment itself is several hundred dollars more than I receive in a *whole month*,  and all my savings were used up earlier this year on everything expensive breaking -- my cat (expensive tests for Ellie 2 months in a row), my car, my computer, etc., so there is NO WAY I can afford it without your help!

Time is of the essence now, as she is likely already suffering damage to her organs, & that will lead to other, future health issues -- and I'm hoping to avoid that as much as possible.

So I am asking for a total of to cover all the tests, the treatment, & transportation up & back to the clinic (since it's in San Mateo), and any other costs that may come up during the process.

Again, I know that is a lot to be asking for in these crazy, stressful times we're living in these days, but I do not even have the words to express how grateful I would be to be able to keep my lovecat Ellie in good health & around for a long time to come.

Ellie has been suffering from a really serious gastrointestinal infection the past two days, so I raised the donation goal a little bit to manage the extra cost of the exam, her medication, and the wee pen I had to purchase to build her a safe little ""palace"" while she recovered. ((Also at the vet today, the doctor said that she was worried about some of Lentil's symptoms, & that she really should get a full work-up done, *SO* if people have it in their hearts & capacity, please feel free to donate further to help support Lentil's health (or, at least, her diagnostics) in case she has a serious health problem as well -- EEK!!))

  I adopted Ellie in 2013. The ASPCA warned me she would be a difficult kitty -- she'd been found on the street & was FULL TO THE BRIM of fear-based aggression, but I refused to be daunted.

The first two years were, indeed, incredibly difficult. That whole time my hands and forearms were *covered* in bites and scratches, and sometimes I felt like it was too difficult to persist -- but persist I did.

And happily, with a safe home, lots of love and patience, and a human to call her own, she has grown into the most RIDICULOUSLY SWEET cats I've ever known. She is super mellow & cuddles up easily, gives tons of kisses, purrs her full-throated, motor-like purr frequently (sometimes even just when I come into the room!!), and even DROOLS when she's super happy.

I'm so very lucky to have this munchkin in my life. Even though she has *significant* competition in this realm, she has become the most special-est cat in my life. And both my kitties are legally emotional support cats, which, if ever there was a time I needed them, this would be it!

Thank you so much for your consideration ... and of course for your donation if you make one!!! <3 <3 <3

Help us keep our car and house,"$2,591 raised of $5,006 goal","My wife, son, and I are in a rough place right now. We are asking for $5,006 to avoid foreclosure on our home and repossession on our car. The details of how we got here, how we’re changing things, and what this money goes towards follows.

A year and a half ago, we bought our first home. Our first (and only) child was only 3 months old. Things were going great. We both had relatively decent jobs, we had a great kid, and the future was looking bright.

But life has its way of making things… interesting, to say the least. Stress and depression, as many people often face, got the better of us. The combination of some poor financial decisions (like getting a lot of takeout food), the hospitalization of our son last Halloween, and his subsequent medication dug us a decent hole.

Fundraiser for a Mental Break,$480 raised,"Hello to all you lovely beings.

I've been struggling a great deal with my mental illnesses lately, made even worse when I lost a friend to suicide last month. I'm feeling out of touch with myself to the point where I need a major reset. I found a retreat not too far from me that I think will really help, and though it's more affordable than other options, the price tag is beyond what I can handle at this time. The retreat is run by vocal coaches and a counselor, and as a singer I feel this will be particularly good for me.

Mom needs your help,"$2,355 raised of $5,000 goal","My mother, Sharon, is a saint. Undeserving of the medical problems she's facing. She doesn't smoke, drink, drug, or to my knowledge even cuss.

Terminally ill and in need of medicine.,$460 raised,"Hi there. I randomly met the man in the photo, Jack, and his family plus fur babies (Sam Sam is the big pillow in the picture). One day I was headed to the supermarket and saw a LOT of dogs on a hillside by the highway. Then a few yards down, was a man holding the biggest cardboard sign I’d ever seen. The sign was asking for dog food. So I returned from the store with the biggest bag of kibble I could find, hiked it up the hill, and met Jack for the first time. His dogs were safe, happy, healthy, friendly, and loved. Jack was grateful, but didn’t skip a beat in telling his story.
While I listened to his story others came up with food for the dogs, it was pretty cool to see the generosity of strangers. I didn’t have much time, but in the time I did have I learned that Jack had a large family, not just dogs, that were without a home and lacked basic needs. Since that encounter I have been back to see Jack every two or three weeks; each time laden with food, drinking water, and some very basic essentials. The dogs don't need help, the humans do.

Help Katherine pay for medications,"$2,266 raised of $2,560 goal","I’m Katherine and I’m raising money to help pay for medications that I am struggling to afford. My goal is to raise enough money to cover 4 months of medication. My stretch goal is enough money to cover medications until my FSA is renewed next year.

Why do I need your help? Before I got COVID-19 in October 2022, I already had high medical costs because I have several autoimmune disorders and fibromyalgia. In 2021 and 2022, I maxed out my FSA and still the cost of medications, appointments, labs, and other medical expenses I paid out of pocket added up to $8,000 - $10,000. Unfortunately, we spent almost all our savings on healthcare in those years, leaving us with very little cushion to help with these expenses.

Help Sally Afford Ongoing Medical Treatment,"$2,955 AUD raised of $5,000 goal","Thankyou for taking the time to look at this page. My name is Sally and I am 26 years old. For much of my life I have lived with autoimmune issues such as severe dermatitis, eczema, asthma, alopecia (hair loss) and anaphylaxis. Despite this I strive hard to live a normal, happy life. My day to day generally consists of doctors appointments, drug trials, hospital visits and various medications. As no doctor has ever been able to successfully diagnose all my issues, my treatment is always ongoing. Most of the medication Im prescribed causes side effects, resulting in a vicious cycle of taking one drug to counteract another. As a last resort to stop my immune system attacking itself, I was put on immunosuppressants at 15. However, about a year ago I was taken off my medication (immunosuppressants) against my wishes by a practising doctor. I attempted to explain why I needed to be on such a form of drug, but he refused to give it to me stating I was too young and it was detrimental to my body. Two months later as a result I lost over 50% of my hair because my alopecia flared up, my dermatitis got worse and I developed severe depression and anxiety. I lost my job and have been unable to work for over 6 months because it became too difficult to leave the house. I started having regular panic attacks, excessive sweating and withdrew myself. While I have fought hard and am back on track I still have to take about 14 different medications each day to keep my problems at bay (costing on average $1,000 a month).  I still have injections in my scalp, blood tests, laser surgery (result of weight gain from steroids) and regular appointments with a dermatologist, GP, immunologist, psychologist and psychiatrist. For example one montly appointment with my dermatologist can cost $800, plus a few hundred more if I need injections etc. (because I see specialists their fees and meds are often not subsidised).  I am still unable to return to work due to severe anxiety and depression and am struggling to pay for not only medications but also rent. As I'm sure you can understand, the specialists, treatments and medications I need are very expensive, and unfortunately ongoing. There have already been times where I have opted out of treatment and medication simply because I couldn't afford it. This post is not only to raise money but also awareness for alopecia. People need to understand even though some of my problems may be aesthetic, doesnt mean they aren't extremely detrimental to mental health. So please, anyone who is affected or would simply like to chat do not hesitate to reach out to myself or someone else. I have struggled with alopecia for 12 years and the hardest part was lack of understanding and awareness. I appreciate your time and ask anyone reading this if you have anything to spare it would be greatly appreciated! All I'm striving for is keeping a roof over my head and my body as healthy as it can be!  Thank you so much for your time.

Help getting Adrian into treatment,"$4,185 raised of $5,000 goal","I am writing this in regards to my son, Adrian Posey. Adrian is currently in the Henderson county detention center with drug charges and a $5,000 bond that I cannot afford. Adrian has been struggling with drug addiction and the lifestyle that it brings for the past few years. As much as I have wanted to deny this, I have seen it coming and have been powerless in my fight against it. I know all to well the struggle with addiction as I, myself am in recovery after a 20 year battle. I pray Adrian gets help sooner than I did. I was blessed to be able to go long term treatment at WARM where Dale Sights, Nicole Frields and staff helped me learn a new way of life and then drug court in Henderson taught me how to live and stay sober outside of treatment. Long term treatment and drug court definitely set me in the right direction for long term sobriety. I am praying my son, Adrian is given the opportunity I was to receive the help he truly needs.

Help me pay for my sisters rehab,"$4,577 raised of $24,000 goal","Hi, My name is Dovid i  am reaching out to you about my older sister Bracha. My sister is a loving and selfless person. She has always been happy and full of life. Last year, she Baruch hashem had the opportunity to go to Neve Yerushalayim   for the year. While there, she took a wrong turn and got caught up with the wrong friends. She was influenced for the worse, and got involved with drugs and alcohol. Ever since then, she has been struggling and fighting to break this addiction. Some people may say that drug addiction is a choice, while most people do not understand it. Unfortunately, I have seen first hand that drug addiction is a disease. It is a constant battle which causes tremendous pain and fear, not only for her, but for us.... her family. As her brother, it has come to a point where I cannot just sit and watch her succumb to this addiction. I cannot live anymore with the fear that one day, Chas V'shalom, the addiction will win over her and she won't be with us anymore. She has realized that the only way she could save herself is by going to a rehab program, which she has agreed to do, knowing it was the best option. Her teachers suggested that she go to Rabbi Burns 12 step program in Florida. Although we understand that this could save her life, it pains us because with our family's financial situation we cannot afford to send her. Since I knew it would be the best thing for her, I have taken it upon myself to raise the money. I have successfully been able (with the help of many kind people) to raise $24,000 already.  We now have $24,000 left to raise and at this point, I have nowhere else to turn. As she continues to battle this addiction, it has not stopped her from doing everything in her power to grow and fight as hard as she can. Since the very beginning we have not strayed from our emunah and our bitachon in Hashem that He will bring my sister inner peace. Here is a girl who has a life full of amazing potential waiting for her and I refuse to allow drug addiction to take that away. Please help me help her. If we don't raise the money, she will be forced to lose this oppurtunity of rehab to heal herself. I am turning to you with the hopes that you can help me. Please...help me get my family back. Please help me get my sister back.
Thank you.

Single mom still struggling after echo man. Fire.,"$2,013 raised of $20,000 goal","Hello my name is Dominique Long. My son and I had recently moved in with my parents when they lost their home in the echo mtn fire. I lost everything I owned, wasn't even able to grab a back pack for us. I lost a life time of tools I had slowly been acquiring, weed eater, saws drills, wheelbarrows. Surf boards, tack, camping gear. Things I will not be able to afford to replace anytime soon and sometimes wonder if I ever will. There has been an out pouring of generosity for the fires and I'm not saying I am ungrateful I'm just saying I need help. So far my aid is a total of 1000$ and some stuff from the grange, honestly most things in my home are from craigslist or friends though. I have spent the last 2 years talking to aids trying to get support with bills but it at this point has been completely fruitless. Lots of people that lost housing in the fire were provided with housing after words. I was not. I found a trailer to rent and did that for over a year. I bought a trailer as back up to put on my parents property just in case. And ended up losing my ass on it and still owe a couple thousand dollars on it.lots of people were also given fema aid red cross aid or insurance money. I got nothing. I had to pull money out from a lawyer to cover living expenses. A lawyer that I had gotten to settle a custody issue and hopefully finally after 6 years get some sort of child support. Im in debt struggling to pay bills, behind on rent which makes me at risk of losing my home. My credit has been destroyed through all this so their isn't any borrowing money for me. My truck is starting to act up and I can't afford to fix it. I also now desperately need a root canal and insurance won't cover it. I've lived here for over 30 years coached basketball, track and cross country over the years and even youth group, I was very involved in 4h for years, I don't do drugs. I'm honest....I'm a good person, I hate asking for help but I'm at the end of my rope and I'm afraid if I don't ask I'll be homeless and loose custody of my child. Please help me. I've been struggling for so long and I just need hand up. I'm asking 20, 000 because that's what I put into the insurance company. It's also pretty close to what I'd need to fix all my financial struggles right now. So it seems like a good number. Please help or share if you can't help.

We've been struggling with money for a while because of stability in work. I know most people will tell me that I shouldn't have pets because I can't take care of them. Ever since I was a kid, we always had a pet in the house, the pets I've had as a young kid have passed away. Around middle school, my dad surpsied me and my siblings for christmas with a puppy (shiro: black and white dog in the picture). Shiro is allergic to fleas, she gets an allergic reaction to them and her skin gets to itch so bad to the point where she bites herself or rubs her back on hard surfaces and she bleeds. I finally had enough money to take her to the vet and they told me she needed to be on medication for her dermatitis. It was expensive and I haven't been able to buy her another dose because of money struggles so her skin isn't doing well again. My cats don't have the same problem but they all still have fleas, its extremely expensive buying the flea ointment for them. I have 2 male cats, I had enough money to neuter my cat Salem (black cat) but it costed me around 900 because of exams, vaccines, and the actual surgery. I can't afford my other pets but I have to get them neutered and spayed because We've already had 3 litters and it's extremely difficult finding kittens a home. Melissa (multicolored cat), she's pregnant again, this would be her 4th litter. I don't know what to do with the kittens other than taking them to a shelter, if anybody wants a kitten please let me know and contact me on my instagram @spidersskull . I dont want to get rid of them because I have a very strong attachment to them. Shiro is very attached to me and gets attach anxiety if I'm away from her so she has to always be with me. Salem and Melissa, I got them both from a friend who passed away in 2022, I can't let go of them. The three other cats are Spider, Ojitos, and Pablo, they are Salem and Melissas kids. I really don't want to get rid of my pets so please help me and donate to help me keep them. Thank you.

"Disabled, Struggling with Bills & Medical Issues","$2,304 raised of $7,500 goal","Hello, my name is Emma. A year ago I had a serious accident and found myself severely disabled because of it. Because of this, I’ve been unable to work, have had extreme medical expenses, am still in physical therapy just to walk, and am currently in a legal battle with the government over disability claim payments.

I have no money anymore. I’ve had to put basic living expenses from the past year on credit cards that I can’t afford to pay off, and am beginning to panic at the pit I have found myself in. I can no longer afford to live, my monthly expenses are too large for someone with zero income stuck in a legal battle for disability payments, even with my family helping me where they can. We are poor, and struggling, and I just don’t know what to do anymore.

"Dr, Transport, Kidney Failure Treatment","$3,175 raised of $10,000 goal","Hi my name is Ronnie Owens, I suffer from kidney disease and neuropathy. I am seriously struggling to afford Drs and medication, I do not have, nor can I afford health insurance. I am unable to work, most days I have trouble leaving the house due to the pain and discomfort. There is no assistance or side funds able to help me. If I am able to get this taken care of, I will not have to worry about my life or the pain and suffering anymore.

"Please help save our home, family and dog","$335 AUD raised of $30,000 goal","Hi, I’d like to stay anonymous so I’m going by the name Grace. My family is struggling really bad. My mum is on the Disability Support Pension which gives us near nothing, because she has a lot of mental health problems that have lead her to being unfit to work. My dad has just been put into a medical facility to help him as he has just had a mental break down, suffering with Depression and hasn’t been able to work for the last month. We are at risk of being evicted from our rental property as it’s almost 2.5k a month and we can’t afford to move. We are in debt to family and friends with both of my parents not working and me and my brother don’t make enough money to support 4 people and a dog. We desperately need money for rent, food, dog food, medication for my parents mental health, as well as car repayments. Our dog is 11 years old, losing her sight and her legs are going, we are worried we won’t be able to afford to take her to the vet if something worsens. She can only keep one brand of food down without being sick and we’re struggling to afford it. I know staying anonymous might make people less likely to donate and I completely understand, my family is just feeling really embarrassed about anyone we know seeing this. We need at least 25k to pay everyone back and afford to cover all our expenses i mentioned but I’ve made the goal 30k hoping it would give us a couple of extra months to get us back on our feet and give my dad time to recover and find work again. I know I’m asking for a lot but honestly any amount will help us tremendously.

Please Help Me Afford New POTS Management Tech!,$315 raised of $514 goal,"Hi, my name is Jess. If you're reading this, then you already know some of the struggles I've faced in my life. And, as you also know, the struggles have never seemed to stop coming my way.

After losing my Dad at 13 years old, my life was turned upside. For 17 years after that, I was in a body that tried to live with a mind that just wanted to die. Genetic testing became available and paid for through insurance. It was then that I found the right medication in order for my mind to be set free and finally thrive.

Less than 2 years later, I became ill. This time, my body was in so much pain, I became weak, I had trouble breathing, my heart rate skyrocketed no matter what I was doing, and so much more. I could barely function anymore. After almost 2 years, hundreds of tests, and at least 15 doctors, a diagnosis was set in stone: POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome) accompanied by Small Fiber Neuropathy, Mast Cell Activation Syndrome, and more.

Afford Psychiatry for my Bipolar Disorder,$225 raised of $750 goal,"Hello! Anyone seeing this probably already knows me, but I'm Amelia. I'm setting up this go fund me to help afford some visits with a Psychiatrist so that I can finally get medicated for my bipolar disorder. My current job barely makes ends meet and definitely doesn't pay enough to afford a psychiatrist. I've struggled with my bipolar disorder for a long while and have been unmedicated for years now. I'm making a push to resolve this soon so that I can have the energy to search for a new job that will pay more (offer health insurance) and the emotional stability to hold it down.

I'm setting the goal for 750$.. the estimates I've seen in my area for uninsured psychiatry visits are essentially 300$ for initial consultation and 150$ for every visit thereafter. These places I'm looking at are also gender-affirming. I'm not exactly sure how often I'll need to go for visits, but I imagine for the first while I'll have weekly visits to monitor my mood, to figure out what medication works and to dial in the dosages. I will inquire about any way to reduce the costs since my income is low, but I'm unsure what the availability of that is going to be. In the past I haven't had a whole lot of luck with that in regards to psychiatry. The 750$ allows for worst-case 4 visits (~1 month of visits), not including the money I'm putting towards this myself via credit card. If there happens to be any extra or leftover funds I will put them towards therapy, which I hope to start as soon as possible, likely after I land a new job.

,"$535 raised of $3,000 goal","Hello friends,

My name is Breanna. I'm trying to raise money to help my mama afford her insulin and other medicines.

A few months ago, my stepfather switched jobs. Because of that, my parents don't have insurance at the moment. Unfortunately, my mother was admitted to the hospital on July 6th and she was there for about a week. Since that hospital visit, the doctors have put her on antiseizure medications and quite a bit of insulin to help maintain her blood sugar levels. Her hospital stay alone has generated over $50,000 in medical bills but our main concern is being able to afford her insulin. Not having her insulin would be life threatening.

Save Morgan Buyaki Life,"$20,305 CAD raised of $200,000 goal","Hi I am April and Morgan is my daughter. It is a very humbling experience to beg for my daughters life. 
  She has been diagnosed with an extremely rare vascular disease E.G.P.A which is fatal untreated. The life saving medication is NUCALA an injection of 300ml once a month. Seems simple …But that injection costs between $7200.00-$10,000.00 per month ($2400.00-$3200.00 PER each ml ) !?! How? Why?   To watch my child suffer and die when I know there is medication but it is impossible to afford. 
  We are Canadian ( born & raised here for generations paying huge taxes) and our health care system is supposed to help in cases such as this. NUCALA is on the list of approved drugs coverage in Canada. Her doctors have filled out the forms & applied repeatedly and finally they conceded to cover only 100mg of the 300mg she needs and say we are responsible for the remaining 200mg. At a cost of $2400.00-$3200.00 PER each 100mg this is not possible and completly unaffordable!!! I don’t understand why the government is letting her die.

My cat is sick and I can't afford to help her..,$215 raised of $700 goal,"Hello, my name is Cory and my cat's name is Rocket. I have had her for a little over 14 years now and she's been normally really healthy. As of recent though, she has developed hyperthyroidism, we just recently found out what it is because of my veterinary assistant teacher. My family is going through some struggles at the moment and can't afford a vet check up, let alone the possible medication and surgery that she might need.

The amount you donate here will go to the check up, blood work, and possibly medication that she might need, but if she needs surgery I will have to increase the total as we for sure can't even get close to affording it alone.

I love my cat, with all my heart, she is my pride and joy and I don't want her to be suffering like this any longer than she has to..

I hope you can help, thank you for at least considering it.","Hesperia, CA"
Car Crisis Relief: Fundraiser for Vehicle Repairs,"$1,760 raised of $2,500 goal","Hi, my name is AJ and since the pandemic I've been really struggling to get caught up on my debts and have been living paycheck to paycheck. The food I consume most days is ramen (cheap). I'm not sure how I'm gonna afford my medication this month and now I'm struggling with getting funding to fix my car. I found out today that because it's a transmission problem they are charging me over $2,000. I don't have any ill will towards them as they have been extremely kind and understanding and this was the discounted amount (I will be saving over $200). I never ask for help but I'm truly running out of options.

Help Hayley Afford Spravato Treatment for TRD,"$385 raised of $1,500 goal","A lot of you don’t know this, but i’ve been struggling with MDD (major depressive disorder) and recently found out that it’s treatment resistant. For the past 10 years of my life, i’ve tried 18 different psychiatric medications to give me relief from my symptoms which unfortunately have not worked. May of 2020, I tried to take my own life, thankfully I did not. But January 16 of 2024, I was 2 cm away from taking my own life which has put a big dent in my recovery. This led to the conclusion that my depression, ptsd and anxiety are no longer improving with medications, therapy and intensive outpatient care. I am left with the new FDA approved Ketamine therapy called Spravato. After months of reaching out to medical facilities and interviews, I was approved by my insurance for treatment, but that comes with the cost of medication and a copay twice a week for the next several months.
I’m asking for the amount that would cover my treatment for the next 6 months. I want to get better. I want the help. I need the help. And this is my last resort. If you know of anyone or even yourself that can donate, it would be nothing but helpful. I want to no longer wake up with suicidal ideations and the intrusive thoughts of not wanting to be alive anymore. Of thinking the world would be a better place without me. 
Please, I am asking for everyone to please donate so I can get the treatment I need to hopefully begin to recover from this awful disease. For those who know me, maybe you’ve had the unfortunate experience of seeing the effect it has taken on me at work and even at home. And i appreciate everyone who has tried their damn hardest at making me comfortable and reminding me everyday that there will be a treatment and things will get better.

Help Luna afford brain surgery,"$1,152 CAD raised","Hello, my name is Mia and I’m Luna’s mom! She’s such a lovely little 3 year old Russian Blue mix and has always been my baby. However she’s always been a little sick with ongoing vet visits and different health struggles.

Recently in the last year she’s been struggling with seizures and medication hasn’t helped. She’s been slowing down, eating less and seizing more frequently (7 times in the last three days) and we’ve spent all that we can on the vet without being able to find the cause.

Unfortunately as my family doesn’t have a good source of income and I am a working student, I can’t afford to help her anymore as much as I wish I could. I want to get a brain scan done and if needed a surgery to save and help my lil girl’s life. She’s still got so much to go.

Donate to help Heather afford treatment,"$2,068 raised of $4,900 goal","Hi! My name is Heather and I am trying to fundraise money so I can afford eating disorder treatment. I have been struggling with a restrictive eating disorder for a few years now and have been trying to recover for a year. My eating disorder completely took over my life and it left me mentally and physically ill. It is incredibly difficult to recover from an eating disorder without any support. I have been to multiple treatment centers, but my eating disorder still has a hold on me, leaving me to feel hopeless and helpless. I decided to give myself another shot at recovery and was evaluated by a clinical team to see if I need treatment. I was recommended a residential level of care, which includes 24/7 support, therapy, meal support, and much more. Eating disorder treatment is incredibly inaccessible and costly. While I do have insurance, my out of pocket expenses are high. Being a student $18,000 in debt, unable to work, and with limited family support, the financial burden has fallen on me. The funds that are raised will go towards my stay, therapy, medication and meals. It will also cover transportation, housing, and groceries when I step down to the next level of care. I am motivated to get my life back and live life in recovery. Thank you in advance for all of your support!","Greensburg, PA"
Help Erin Pay for Healthcare,"$9,531 AUD raised of $10,000 goal","In January 2019, I undertook elective vision corrective laser surgery in Sydney. Within a matter of days, I was suffering from intense pain on both corneas. I have since been diagnosed with bilateral neuropathic corneal eye pain (nerve damage) as a direct result of the surgery.

The surgery has impacted greatly the state of my physical and mental health and I am currently still experiencing high levels of pain in both eyes. I have been forced to spend substantial sums of money on health care and medications (estimated at almost $25 000) which has posed a significant financial burden that I struggle with to this day. I have been admitted to hospital multiple times recently to receive treatment and support due to my ongoing health concerns. Due to the impact of the medications I’m taking, I have struggled to leave the house since being discharged from hospital. It’s hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel at the moment as my physical health experience has taken a massive toll on the state of my mental health.

Please Help Me Get My Life Back,"$2,190 raised of $7,000 goal","Hi, my name is Sam. I’ve been a freelance artist since 2016 after losing my job for mental health reasons. Around that time I was diagnosed with severe depression, ADHD, and Bipolar Type II, and Prolactinoma. Before I was properly medicated, I attempted to take my life and immediately got help.
I was recommended a therapist, but could never make enough to see one, even with insurance. However, I was able to afford my psychologist visits and keep on my medication for a bit. Freelancing worked alright for me until 2 years ago, where I was hit with a very sudden and devastating divorce with my partner of 8 years. For 6 months, I couldn’t function. I couldn’t get out of bed, could no longer afford my medication because I wasn’t working and lost my health insurance, so my mental health declined, and my debt grew.

Since then, I haven’t been able to catch up. For a while I shamefully fell to alcohol abuse to cope, which only made things worse. And in November of 2019, I lost my ability to function again. I can barely take care of myself physically, the depression has become so severe I can no longer draw, and that was my only source of income. For a while my car stopped running, and I couldn’t afford the insurance which led to a suspension on my license, so I can’t find work. I don’t even have enough to get a bus pass, which is the only other option with how notoriously bad public transportation is in Florida. I now have very unhappy clients wanting money back I don’t have, or art I don’t know if I can provide anymore. All while I’m struggling to feed myself, take care of my cats, and keep a roof over my head.

I feel like I’ve hit rock bottom. Every day for the past few months the only comfort I felt had been in ending it all. But I know I can’t do that to the people in my life.

Instead of ending my life on this note, I want to get my life back. For myself, my family, my friends, my cats. I want to be able to draw and create again, to use my ability to help inspire and move others, and feel like life is worth the hardships it throws.

This is where I need your help. Having this funded could get me the help I need and completely turn my life around. The funds for this would go towards depression rehabilitation, having my medication again, getting my car running and legal so I can have transportation while I find a job, keeping my house for 2 months while I recover, necessities for my cats, and refunding clients who I’ve been unable to deliver to.

Here is an approximate funding breakdown:

- ~$4,000
 - $175
- $194
- $150
- ~$400 
- $1,114
- ~$600, with the potential to grow

= ~$6,536

The difference would go towards food/litter/medication for my cats, gas for my car, food, and possible additional refunds. If this somehow goes past the initial funding goal, I can also schedule an MRI and seektreatment for my prolactinoma, which I could never afford to do.

This breaks my heart to write. I’m terrified, and don’t like asking for help. But I’ve done everything I can, and things just keep getting worse, and I’ve run out of options to get myself out. I’m not asking for anyone to take care of me while I do nothing, I want to use this opportunity to get a jumpstart to turn my life around and get a job so I can take care of myself again, and take back everything I let my illnesses take from me.

I will be happy to answer any questions, provide any proof, anything. Thank you for reading, and potentially helping change someone’s life for the better who’s almost given up.

From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

Help Cameron afford TMS treatments,"$760 raised of $9,250 goal","Hi, all! It feels weird to be doing this because I don’t really feel like I deserve anyone’s hard-earned money but I’m running out of choices. I’ve been suffering from depression for as long as I can remember and have been in every hospital, taken every pill you can think of. The medicines I’m on now have numbed it but I still struggle with just staying alive each day. I want to work, to spend time with friends and family, to have hobbies; but I have no energy and my emotions are drained. All I do is sleep and have panic attacks.

Finally, though, I’ve found a doctor who has approved me for TMS. TMS is a treatment that uses magnetic pulses to treat areas of the brain affected by mental illness. It is not people’s first choice in treatment and is usually saved for people like me who have not gotten relief through medication - kind of a last ditch effort, if I’m being perfectly honest.

Psychologist and therapist mental health treatment,$275 raised of $375 goal,"Hi my name is Steven. I’ve been on medication basically my whole life..I suffer from extreme and crippling panic, anxiety, and depression that has only been heightened post pandemic and by my declining financial situation…I’ve been seeing a mental health doctor for over 3 years who prescribes multiple medications that keep me functional. Lately, things have been so tough for me financially, I can hardly afford to keep food on the table for my family let alone pay for my doctor and my medications. I still owe for last months visit, plus this upcoming appointment..I’m terrified that I will not be able to afford to pay them and I won’t be able to get my medications. To make matters worse, I don’t have a car and his office is 30min away… so even if I can find a ride there the rideshare back alone is easily 45 bucks, And there are no busses near me. I’m really just hoping to earn enough to get there and back and pay him for last month, this month, and the next month to give myself some breathing room to figure it all out. I’ve thought about just not going and not taking my medications anymore but I’ve done that in the past and the withdrawals and side effects alone were something I wouldn’t wish on anyone. I’m also not myself without my medication..I really do need them to function. So if there’s anyway anyone can help me out, you’d be helping out my family too who have to deal with me on a daily basis. I feel bad asking strangers and people I know for a little help but honestly I have no where else to turn. All donations will go towards my next two medical health treatments and medications and rides if needed. Anything left over or if by some stroke of God I go over my goal, I will use the rest towards the next month of treatment.

Miles Memorial Fund to Help Addicts,"$5,565 raised of $15,000 goal","With heavy hearts, we share the passing of our son, brother, and friend, Miles Plarisan, on 1/24/17. He is no longer bound by the chains of addiction; his spirit is free to soar. 

Miles was a brilliant soul who never truly felt free to shine.  Music was his calling and written words were his language. Vulnerable and playful, insatiably curious and mostly longing, Miles was always longing.

Miles faced an unbreakable struggle with drug addiction and was forced to live with this burden for years. Through the struggle and pain, Miles found the strength to shine for others. He listened when no one else would; he helped when no one else could. Unconditionally, he shared his love. He treated children like equals with patience and pure enjoyment because it gave him freedom, a chance to be a kid again.

We know many of you have been touched by addiction and depression in one way or another. We only hope that Miles' passing will give a bright future to someone engulfed in the addiction spiral and that our grief can help others battling this incomprehensible battle. 

We ask that you please make a donation in Miles' name to help those suffering with addiction. Your donation will go to Pathways Recovery in Roseville, CA to help someone in need of a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program. ()

Everyone who knew Miles knows that his heart was full of love for others and would be there for those in need.
Your support, whether it be in the form of words of kindness or contributing to the fund, is greatly appreciated. Thank you.

We love and miss you Miles.

""I think of how strong people like you will never die.
People like you don't just disappear.
They don't vanish.
They don't give up.
People like you last forever.""

Ron and Kim Hernandez need your help!,"$13,410 raised of $20,000 goal","Ron and Kim Hernandez are the most selfless people I have ever met.  Last year Ron was diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma, a form of cancer.  He has been undergoing chemo therapy treatment for the last year.  The treatment completely wipes him out yet he never stops trying to help further the cause of his organization Moving Veterans Forward.   

Since the founding of Moving Veterans Forward (MVF) 9 years ago, he has helped over 1500 homeless veterans and their families in the surrounding area find housing and get on the path to becoming self reliant.  Neither Ron nor any of his team are paid anything to run the organization.  They run it all out of the goodness of their heart, partly due to Ron being a fellow Vet himself.  

While Ron has been dealing with his cancer diagnosis, Kim has been fighting her own health battle.  On January 25th, 2020 Kim had a horrific fall at home.  She was attempting to let her dogs out when she tripped and fell and broke her arm in 3 spots and broke her leg.  For an otherwise healthy person this fall would have been catastrophic but for Kim it was even more devastating.  Kim already relied on both hands to be able to use canes to help her walk as she has endured 8 surgeries on her hips over her life time. 

Kim will now be spending 6 weeks in a rehabilitation center, mostly because it is not safe for her to come home.  Ron and Kim live in a multi-level home.   After Kim's last surgery she was mostly confined to her room as she could not navigate the many stairs in her home.   They have struggled to live in their own home for the last few years.  

Kim and Ron are now struggling to afford all of their medical bills.  Cancer drugs are very expensive.  Kim will need to be able to return home but unfortunately her home is not suited for her.  There are several steps up to the front door and then more steps to her room.  Ron has just started his next round of chemo again and struggles to keep food down and take care of his family.  Kim will need a lot of support but so will Ron.  

For a family that has given everything they have to serve our community and more importantly serve our most vulnerable veterans, we can do better!  Ron received an award in November for the non profit of the year.  Lets make that award mean something.  I'm asking for your help!  Lets help this selfless family afford their much needed medications, lets help them get a ramp installed to their home and lets help ease their burden if only for a moment.

Medication costs,$130 AUD raised of $500 goal,"Hi my name is lilly and I am fund-raising to afford my medication

Save my husband,"$2,200 raised of $24,000 goal","My husband and I went through Katrina and lost our home and my career all in one day.  We struggled and struggled through financial issues and depression and finally came out the other side of a very difficult 13 years.  During this time we were not able to afford insurance.  We avoided doctors and did no check ups at all because we could not afford it.  Two years ago we opened a store where we help people with chronic pain WITHOUT the use of opiates or drugs.  We are making it now and are self supportive and helping people every day which is amazingly rewarding.  

We bought insurance almost 2 years ago.  Finally.  But, insurance companies can drop you for any reason during the first 6 months and the first policy we got was an annual policy - still no visits to doctors because of fear of being dropped.  After the first year we were able to switch to a normal policy (we thought).  We waited the 6 months out and then finally went in for check ups.

My husband has a liver problem that if goes untreated can be deadly.  He is my life!  We just discovered that the insurance were able to afford insurance does NOT cover medicine.  So, we can not afford the prescription meds that the doc says will save him.  The medicine is $24,000.  He must take these pills for 8 weeks.  At first we were told each pill (1 a day) would cost $1,000 but doc thought would be covered by insurance.  Now, today, the drug company said it will cost ONLY $24,000.  We just don't have it.  After finding out that we do not have prescription coverage we are lost and terrified.  The meds will save his life - I can not lose my husband.  He is my life partner, my best friend, my world!  We need the meds ASAP to stop any further damage to his liver.

I just don't know what to do!  So, I thought maybe I could ask for help.  Please, if you have some extra money and want it to go to a good cause - there is NO better cause than saving the man I love!  We have three children who love their daddy too!

Cancer Bill's & Medications,"$1,785 raised of $10,000 goal","In September of 2017 I was diagnosed with stage 4 Stomach cancer. After several rounds of chemotherapy I was told that it was terminal due to the spreading of the Cancer. I had no idea that it's not about saving a life when it comes to cancer, it's about that almighty dollar. And without that dollar the basic medication needed just to survive becomes an obstacle as well. Medications are so expensive that sometimes you say to hell with it. It's a struggle trying to come up with the money to pay for your daily medications. No matter what happens in this life I will never give up nor quit because things get rough. I dont have too many options but I do know that I have alot of friends and family that truly care and love me for who I am. Regardless of what the Doctor says I know God has the final say. I will find out a way to continue paying for this medication even if I have to ask the world for their help. I Will Survive!! So to my friends and family I come before you and ask that you give what you can. Any and everything will help in the end. Believe it or not some medication is close to$ 1,000 for a 3 month supply. So of you can afford it please contribute as much as you can and may God bless your heart and your soul!!!!!","Los Angeles, CA"
Lucia Barrios funeral costs,"$500 raised of $25,000 goal",Hi i’m here to ask for your support in helping me and my family raise money to be able to afford my mom’s funeral costs. My mom recently passed away on the 20th due to drug addiction and overdose. My mom and I were really close until she started to lose herself from these drugs and alcoholism. She was a great mom to me before this all happened and i’m glad she still tried her best to care for me and my sisters even in the state she was in. I wish she could’ve changed and given the opportunity to stop and come back but it wasn’t possible . We really need help and your support to afford this because we also struggle with money and having to pay bills so this is a lot of money we’re going to need to afford all of this. It’s really hard to even think about it because i’m barely turning 15 and my year has become devastating already . I can’t process the things that come into my head knowing my mom is gone forever. But she will finally be resting in peace now. Thank you for your time.,"Santa Clarita, CA"
Knight Family Medical Struggles,"$4,900 raised of $10,000 goal","Over the years I have contributed to Go Fund Me Accounts, but never thought I would be starting one; however, the time has come.

My daughter, Sarah, has severe Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) which causes excruciating pain in the affected joints. In years past, opiates were the only way to bring relief to patients with chronic pain, but there are now long acting, non-narcotic medications on the market. In January, Sarah's  pain management doctor prescribed Butrans which is a patch that lasts for a week. After just a few days, Sarah had incredible results and did not have to take any other pain meds. After the first month's success, she went to the pharmacy to refill the prescription but it was denied.  The insurance company dropped Butrans from its formulary. They are cutting their costs by only approving opiod treatment for pain management, regardless of the damage this can cause to the patient. This forced Sarah to go back to opiates which is not what she wants. Her RA is being treated with infusion therapy and steroids and she will have this treatment throughout her life because there is no cure for RA. This is why non-opioid drugs are so important.

Sarah's physicians have called the insurance company explaining her need for Butrans patches but the insurance company still denied the medication. Sarah has written to and called Perdue which is the company that manufactures Butrans. Their first question...what is your husband's income? Their immediate response....denied financial asistance. She also tried to get a medical grant, but was denied because of the income.

So if the family income is good, what is the probem? 

Sarah and Kevin have four children. Their youngest son, Cooper, was born with Mitochondrial Disease and spent most of his life in and out of Texas Children's, Memorial Hermann Children's and Pittsburgh Children's hospitals where he had a colon/small bowel transplant. Six years ago he died at age four.

After Cooper's death, the three survivng children were all tested and that is when they learned that their son, Oliver, has the same form of Mitochondrial Disease that took his brother's life. Oliver is now twelve, is oxygen dependent,  and his medical bills are astronomical. 

Between Sarah and Oliver's medicines, doctor appointments and co-pays, their monthly out of pocket expenses average between $800 and $1000. In 2016 their total out of pocket medical expenses were over $33,000.

This morning I had to take Sarah to her pain doctor as she was barely able to walk. We discussed all of the avenues we have tried in order to get financial assistance for the Butrans patch . The best coupon price for this medication runs $489 a month which Sarah can not afford.

Sarah's doctor looked at me and said, ""You need to start a Go Fund Me page.""  So here I am. The money you donate will allow Sarah to be able to function as a normal 39 yer old, using a non-opiod  medication.  As her Mom, let me thank you in advance for your kindness and generosity.

Families Fighting Drug Addiction,"$2,283 raised of $5,000 goal","On Friday, July 15, 2016, my only son Brian was tragically taken away from me by a deadly combination of heroin and Fentanyl. He suffered from severe anxiety and was given this deadly mixture, which he was told would help him. His anxiety finally stopped forever, as did his heart. He died instantly and never saw it coming.
Brian was a wonderful, handsome, loving son who had big dreams just like every child. Unfortunately his life was taken away in a split second. I call this murder, and it is happening EVERY DAY. You never in a minute would think this can happen to you and then in one split second your life changes FOREVER.
In memory of my son, I've taken on a quest to put the Brian and Brianna Anti-Addiction bears in the hands of people everywhere:

A good portion of the money generated from every sale will be put aside into a separate fund which will be used to provide addicts  the opportunity to enter a rehabilitation facility  which hopefully will  save their life. Some  of the money will be used to produce more bears and cover expenses to keep this movement alive.  Each bear that is purchased will allow the buyer to submit the name of someone struggling with addiction. This will be ongoing, so the more bears I sell, the more I can help someone in need.

Help Christine Afford Paralegal Education!,"$220 raised of $10,000 goal","Since the age of about 15, I have known that somehow, in some way, I've wanted to pursue a career that involves helping people (specifically within the areas of human rights, gender-based violence, children's rights, or substance abuse).
If you've been around since my high school days, you probably remember activism I have participated in since then. I hosted Red Ribbon Week for multiple years at my Pre-K through 12 school, educating all children in various ways on the cause and effects of drug use. As a member of Student Council, I made sure we focused on things like Awareness Months and general education on the interests mentioned previously.
Now, a decade later, at 25, I am still so passionate about these issues. I have become a resource for so many, and it has inspired me to push further and further. So much so that I have decided to pursue a legal or advocacy route with them.

Hercules Vet Bill,"$3,110 AUD raised","Hi everyone, i have a 8 month old American Staffy x American Bulldog pup his name is Hercules and he was known for being the happiest and most gentle pup at the dog park. However his life took a turn last week 24th August 2020 when he was attacked by another dog at the dog park. He was attacked on the neck and head and given a drain in his neck, stitches to the head, neck and ear. He was on antibiotics and anti anxiety medication after the attack. This alone was a $900 vet bill. He was doing fine and healing well until yesterday 03/09/20 when i arrived home from work and 30 minutes later he began his first seizure. His seizures started mild shaking uncontrollably which then lead to frothing from the mouth and by the time we arrived to the vet he had another major seizure, he was treated with valium to stop the seizure and had a temperature of 41.5 degrees. The first vet bill is $850 at the first vet we arrived to however the tremors did not stop there and he needed overnight care which is $1250 so far. His tremors still haven’t stopped overnight and he is being transferred back to the original local vet which will be another $900. My partner and i have used our last cent to keep our pup alive. As other animals owners know these aren’t just pets they’re family and we are doing everything we can to help our little boy. This gofundme page is being made to cover excess cost of the bills we are struggling to afford and medication needed to treat his seizures until they can figure out the cause. If you could donate even $1 it would mean the world to us to help save our baby boy. Thank you everyone for the kind messages and support, we appreciate it so much.

Bob Mills' Lung Transplant Fund,"$3,550 raised of $30,000 goal","Hello Everyone,  Those of you that know me know that I have been struggling with COPD for many years. I am a product of the 70's and 80's when smoking was acceptable. I quit smoking over 10 years ago, but this disease does not stop. My doctor says I drew the short straw. It is incurable and will continue to get worse until I die or receive a lung transplant. I don't want to die. I am leashed to an oxygen hose 24hrs. a day. I am now listed for both a single and double lung transplant at The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. This required a lot of testing and driving back and forth to Philly many times for the last 3 years. The costs related to this operation are staggering it involves a lifetime of follow-up aftercare, but the first three months to a year are the most intensive, with trips three times a week to the hospital, extensive rehab, and anti rejection medications that can run thousands of dollars a month even WITH insurance. It's enough to bury most people, but I have a lot to live for and have no plans to let this get me. I have an amazing and beautiful wife who has my back and deserves much more than I can provide her with now. I have a grandson down south that I haven't met in person yet. I have many other grandkids and relations that I haven't seen in years. Here, I am asking for something I have never asked for before; financial help. I have very good insurance, but the co-pays, travel, prescriptions, and more, run tens of thousands of dollars. That said, please donate 5, 10, 20, 20,000 dollars, whatever you can afford. It's going to a good cause and what's nice about this website is you can be assured it's only going for medical expenses. Please pray for me.

Struggling Starving Paralegal,"$7,899 raised of $12,000 goal","I am struggling, but don't have it as badly as some. I just need a little assistance to help me survive while I work hard to improve my situation. Can you help?

There are other folks struggling who have it as bad or worse, and I don't blame you if you opt to help someone who is having a harder time than I am. I'm hungry, but I don't have hungry kids, too, and, so far, my pet is still eating every day (even if I don't). I live in a run-down old house, but I have a roof over my head, and some people don't. I have some health issues, but nothing life-threatening, and some people struggle with chronic diseases and illness every day.

That said...I am having a really hard time.

I'm currently a student trying to earn a Paralegal AS degree. I already have two BAs and an MA, but I also have a gap in my resume due to caring for an elderly relative and going back to grad school to earn that MA, and have had difficulty enticing employers despite excellent references and skills. I'm working on the AS, my fourth degree, in hope that I can change career tracks and earn a living.

I've had a run of bad luck which has included an expensive and stressful breast cancer scare that was not covered fully by medical insurance (I ended up paying about EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS that my supposedly excellent insurance refused to cover for STANDARD breast cancer tests like mammograms and biopsies), a sick pet who needed thousands of dollars in surgeries and vet care (and then died anyway, as they do), lightning striking my home and destroying most electronic devices in it, burglars breaking in and stealing what little of value was not destroyed by lightning, my 18-year-old car having engine trouble, and so on. I have no savings left. No credit. No bank account. No income. Nothing of value left to sell off.

I have one relative who allows me to live rent-free in a very old home which is under construction constantly and in desperate need of upgrading (it has no central air, for example, in an area where the temperature is over 100oF for 3-4 months out of the year; the roof leaks, the fixtures are 60 years old, the outlets are almost all two-prong rather than three-prong, the fuses are ancient, etc), but you know what? I'm grateful I am not homeless and living in the backseat of my car. She also helps with some bills when she can, but I never know if a particular utility will be cut off or not. Every few months or so she gives me a few dollars to buy food, but never that much, and she is very begrudging about it, and complains that I am always asking for money. I actually don't, because I don't want to hear that I'm ""always"" asking for help that is so grudgingly offered, so I am hungry a lot of the time.

I have lived in poverty for almost ten years now. I do not go shopping, or buy fast food, or drink alcoholic beverages (too expensive!), or get haircuts, or watch premium cable channels, or go out to eat or to see a movie, or buy books or CDs or DVDs, or travel to see friends. I had to forgo seeing my friends and family for Christmas last year because I couldn't afford the gas money to travel. I haven't been able to buy Christmas or birthday gifts for anyone for about five years, and I have two nieces, both under the age of 7. Kids should get presents on holidays. I'm a bad aunt.

I can't see a dentist, and I badly need to have a filling checked and my teeth cleaned. My glasses are years out of date and need to be upgraded (I worry that I won't pass my eye test next time I have to renew my driver's license), but I can't afford to see an eye doctor or buy new glasses. I lost my medical coverage because I couldn't afford it anymore, so I don't see a doctor: neither a general practitioner or an ob-gyn. I have a bad back, and I'm supposed to have a doctor keep tabs on it. I can't afford to. I am supposed to be going in regularly to make sure I am definitely free of breast cancer, as my results are always inconclusive, due to ""dense tissue,"" but I no longer have access to a doctor. I have applied to several local free medical clinics and have not been accepted (at least not yet, but it has been several months). I do not live close to a Planned Parenthood, and they also still require a little money for things, even if it is a reasonable amount. I can't afford a career counselor or therapist, so I have no one to talk to when I get stressed or depressed (and I have had clinical depression since childhood). I can't afford ANY medicine or medication, not even aspirin, Neosporin, Clearasil, Band-Aids or Pepto-Bismol. I can't afford the vet, and my pet is overdue to get his annual shots (by several months). I can't afford pet food, and if a friend hadn't helped me by sending him some, I don't know what I'd do. He's an exotic pet (a ferret), and he won't eat cat food, dog food or people food, so it's not as if I can go ask a neighbor to borrow a cup of chow for him to eat.

My ""good"" shoes, which I wear to the rare job interviews I get, are about to fall apart, and I've run out of glue to glue the soles back on. I can't afford to buy a pair of pantyhose, mascara, or a lipstick. My professional portfolio website went offline after several years because I couldn't afford the hosting and server fees anymore. My car is on its last legs, and, as noted, is 18 years old, so I try not to drive anywhere. At least it is paid for! I can't afford to take the bus anywhere (I don't have enough change to pay the fare) and I can't afford to feed parking meters downtown. (A family member borrowed my old car this April while her car was in the shop and was so miserable without any cool air in it that she generously paid to have more freon put in, so at least I don't cook inside it when I do drive it around.) I do not drive anywhere very often, though.

If it isn't too hot and I haven't perspired, and if I'm not planning on seeing any other human beings that day and thus I think I can get away with it, I skip washing my hair, or skip a shower for the day altogether, and just clean up with a washcloth or something, because it makes the cost of the hot water and the soap and shampoo and so on stretch and last longer. I have always been almost neurotically clean and well-groomed, so this is torture for me. I feel gross.

I lived without an oven or a stove for three and a half years, most of the rooms in my house are dark because I try to save on lightbulbs and only replace those in rooms where it is necessary (that's a total of four rooms; I have a flashlight for the others) and at one point I lived without phone service for almost a year. I now have my 8-year-old ""dumb"" mobile phone turned back on, and have the cheapest possible plan, so potential employers can call me. I can't actually use it as a mobile phone, as its old charger died, and so now the only way it can even hold enough of a charge to accept calls is for it to be plugged into my (10-year-old) computer via a USB jack.

I tried to earn money by selling plasma and had such a horrible physical reaction to the process that the plasmapheresis place refused to allow me to donate any more. I could go to a doctor, if I still had one, and maybe I could get his or her permission to donate, but I don't have access to a doctor. So I don't qualify to sell plasma.

I looked into medical research tests, but I don't qualify for any in my area. So I can't even volunteer to be a medical guinea pig. On the plus side, I'd have to have some pretty awful diseases to qualify, so I'm not sad that I don't.

I did some online editing and proofreading, but it required being available online for about twelve hours a day, and competing with other editors over who would earn a dollar for editing what, and my perfectionist tendencies meant that doing thorough editing work (for what ended up being peanuts) started to cut into time I needed to be using to focus on my course requirements and homework--and I have a LOT of homework, plus dense legal documents to write and textbooks to read every day--so I reluctantly put that option on the back-burner. I liked doing it, and liked my co-workers, so maybe I can do it again once school is done.

I was looking into doing virtual assistant work, which is a way to telecommute but do administrative assistant work, but I had to cut off my landline since I couldn't afford two different phone numbers (heck, couldn't afford a phone at all for months on end), and a landline is a requirement for those positions. I also have earned a little money by petsitting, housesitting, and doing webdesign, but I can't count on that as steady income.

I'm fairly artsy and craftsy, but can't afford art or craft supplies to make things that I am not guaranteed to be able to sell to anyone. Not that I have a lot of free time to make anything anyway, given that I am OBSESSED with studying and getting excellent grades in school and pleasing my professors with my hard work and diligence and responsibility, so they might be inspired to help me find employment once I graduate.

I have a friend who donates leftover food to me so I can eat. My family has railed about that, claiming to be ashamed that I am accepting charity like that...but they also let me languish in a house with NO food in it AT ALL, and did so once for four days, so I can't afford to worry about how embarrassed they claim they are that I eat donated food. I have to eat. Sometimes I defrost a bag of donation food and discover I have defrosted a bag of gravy--just gravy. Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful for the food, but a Ziploc full of gravy isn't a meal. (It's pretty funny, though.) As for other edibles, well, I can't afford fresh vegetables or dairy products or sweets.

I've had some friends mail me toilet paper and tea and shampoo. I've had other friends buy me lightbulbs and ibuprofin because I couldn't afford to, and was sitting in the dark (helping me buy $3 worth of lightbulbs was apparently not a priority for my family, as I asked repeatedly for help with burnt-out fixtures for about nine months until a friend took pity) and dealing with headaches and cramps without medicine. I have had friends buy me delivery pizza and, you guys, I hadn't been able to enjoy hot pizza in months, and it was absolutely delicious. Delivery pizza is a scrumptious luxury.

I do not qualify for any government assistance, as I don't have children. I had food stamps for two months (which only covers food, not shampoo, pet food, razors, Tampax, soap, conditioner, toilet paper, deodorant, etc.) but was told I don't qualify for that aid. I will probably have to pay back what little they allowed me to have. There is a work requirement--which is fair--but I can't get hired to work the required minimum of at least 20 hours per week. Online work does NOT count.

I have applied to many temp agencies and to fast food places, big box stores, mall retail stores and other businesses and been told I'm ""overqualified."" I keep in touch with the Department of Labor, but my unemployment benefits have long since expired. The local paper prints about a dozen want ads per week, and most are for jobs I am not qualified for, such as long-haul truck drivers, nurses, plumbers, electricians, accountants, dental assistants, and live-in nannies. I am signed up to at least a dozen different job-search websites and send out resumes and applications every day, but rarely get a response (besides ""no""). I'm no longer a cute young thing in my early twenties, either, which closes some doors, even though I have extensive executive assistant, editing, proofreading, and medical librarian experience (you now need an advanced Library Science degree to get hired, or I'd gladly still be a librarian).

I owe the IRS taxes because I cashed out what little savings I had three years ago, out of desperation. That counted as income, surprise!, even though I had earned no other income all year (or the year after that, or the year after that, or the year after that). I have, in fact, HAD no income, and have nothing whatsoever of value to garnish, put a lien on or confiscate, so they settle for sending threatening ""pay us"" letters every month. I'd really like to, as I've been responsible about such things all my adult life, but I HAVE NO MONEY. So I CAN'T.

My class schedule is discouraging to potential temp employers, as apparently they don't really want temporary employees, but actually want to ""try before they buy"" and are looking for temps they can underpay and then transition into permanent employees. That's just a guess, as I have accepted any and all offers the temp agencies have suggested to me, and expressed willingness to interview with employers or work anywhere (or do ANYTHING!) but nothing has panned out so far. I am required to take several classes on campus and there are few available at night or on weekends. I'd be willing--and thrilled--to take all my classes online, but I cannot get ABA-certified unless I take at least four on-campus courses. I will also need to participate in an externship in a few months as one of the last requirements before I graduate with my AS degree and can apply for full-time paralegal work.

I am out of--or running out of--dish detergent, laundry detergent, feminine sanitary supplies, cleaning products, hairball remedy for my pet, batteries, face soap, conditioner, and a hundred other things. I don't drink coffee, but doing without caffeinated soda or tea in the morning--or even some fruit juice--is really difficult.

When I get extra-hungry, I try to just go to sleep and ignore the rumbling in my belly, but I have been having problems with insomnia, partially because I am hungry and stressed out about financial woes and school, so this is not a very effective tactic. I'm lucky if I sleep two hours a night. Sometimes I don't sleep for about two days. I don't feel well, as a result.

I just need a little help to get by until I can get my degree and until my professors--who support me, as I am a good student who gets an A in every class and works hard--can help me network and find a good position in a law firm. I have about a year to go. My family is helping me with some of the tuition (the rest is going to add to my school loan debt), so I just need help with very basic expenses.

Any little bit you can spare is appreciated greatly. I will use whatever I get for necessities like food and toiletries and cleaning supplies, not frivolous things.

I am required to place a goal total, so I selected $100 per week for a year ($5200). A year is the approximately the amount of time I have left to earn my degree. I don't expect to get anywhere near that much; it's just a round number to satisfy the requirement to place a number in the required field.

What your donations can fund:

$1 buys an ink pen for taking notes at school, or a cheap dollar store notebook, or two postage stamps.
$5 buys me a gallon of skim milk with a little change left over, or some fruit juice, or a package of store brand one-ply toilet paper, or a box of Tampax, or a box of dishwasher powder.
$10 buys a bottle of shampoo AND a bottle of conditioner, or a couple of 12-packs of Coke Zero, or ten cans of Chef Boyardee pasta, or three cans of Chunky soup, or toothpaste AND mouthwash AND floss.
$20 means I can open an account at the local credit union, which will make my life a lot easier. Ever try to cash a check with NO bank account? I don't even know where a check cashing place IS, now that the one down the street has been razed to build another CVS.
$25 or less covers a pair of faux-leather Payless work shoes that do not have glued-on holey soles.
$30 buys a big sack of pet food for Murphy the ferret.
$50 buys a tank full of gasoline.
$65 covers my annual car tag (it's that low because my car is that old) and keeps me from getting arrested for not having the right color sticker on my license plate.
$75 buys me an hour with a career counselor or therapist, and that means someone to talk to about my troubles who can offer good advice. (This is her much-reduced rate for very poor people.)
$80 covers all the medications I need each month (which I am not taking because I can't afford them.)
$100 buys a decent amount of groceries, cleaning supplies, pet needs, and toiletries.
$150 usually covers a standard vet visit for Murphy, including standard shots and a check-up, unless the vet finds something wrong, in which case it gets ridiculously expensive.
$200 covers ONE textbook for a paralegal / legal studies class. Sometimes I can get them used, though.

Mango's Surgery,"$1,530 CAD raised of $2,000 goal","As some may know I have been struggling to afford Mango's many vet visits over the past few months while his health has been all over the place- from days of constant vomiting to peeing blood. However we have finally discovered the cause! Huzzah! My boy can be healthy again

After an ultrasound it was discovered that he has several bladder stones and crystals, and a liver shunt. A bile acid test confirmed his liver isn't compromised so luckily no additional surgery for that yet. 
For now it's surgery to remove the stones and flush out his bladder. This surgery along with the pre- and post-op care comes to about $2000
I'm a ""temporary"" single mother to our shiba son as my fiance has moved to Japan ahead of us. He isn't making enough money over there to send financial aid but he is currently still paying the monthly fee for our pet insurance. 

Mango's previous vet trips have put me in a bit of debt and I have been struggling to maintain working two jobs as it is. However he needs this surgery and I will do whatever it takes!

I am asking for your support for his surgery! Any amount is a blessing and I'm beyond grateful to those who have donated their bottles in the past.

The money raised from this fundraiser will go towards his surgery and the debt I've incurred from his vet visits, tests, and medications these last few months. Not including his surgery I've spent around $5k since November.

His surgery is booked for March 3rd 2020
Please send all your love and thoughts for my boy

Help Thomas Simmons afford insulin!,"$1,500 raised of $1,500 goal","Hello everyone, I’ve created this GoFundMe for Thomas in hopes to help him get back onto his feet.  

Thomas has resided for 49 years in Savannah, Georgia where he was born and raised. Thomas has been through a lot of hardship recently with the passing of his mother, father, and his wife who passed away on September 16th two years ago. On top of dealing with tragic loss Thomas also has dealt with the loss of his job earlier this year which meant he lost his health insurance. For Thomas this has been extremely troubling and dangerous because Thomas is also a Type 1 diabetic who requires roughly 50 units of insulin a day. Thomas has had to go days without his insulin, has been hospitalized, and has relied on donations to pay for his own insulin over the past months and has even pawned off his belongs to pay for insulin to keep himself out of the hospital. He has had to walk in the Georgia heat because he doesn’t have adequate access to transportation or communication with others. He must choose between starving himself to stretch his medication out or eating and risking getting sick everyday. Despite going through tragic loss and turbulent times Thomas is hopeful and has been a kind and compassionate soul since I had the pleasure of meeting him. I’m hoping to raise any amount of money to help Thomas get through these times. We would like to make the goal of raising 3,000 because that is roughly the amount of money needed for two months of insulin. Any amount donated is greatly appreciated and will make the difference of surviving for Thomas if his job search and interviewing process isn't successful.
Thank you.  

Thomas wrote this poem about his struggles with Type 1 diabetes and misfortune titled,  
 
“The Struggle Is Real” 
 
What are people thinking 
When they walk past my sign... 
Are they stereotyping and categorizing 
inside their simplistic minds? 
 
Do they ever stop to wonder 
How this disease has complicated my life... 
It has robbed women of their husbands  
And men of their wives. 
 
Diabetes Mellitus... 
What in the world, what in the name? 
This disease has come into the picture 
and totally changed the game. 
 
If you were a diabetic and had no insurance 
Tell me, what would you do? 
You could wake up one morning pouring sweat, and vision blurred... 
And just like that you’re a diabetic too. 
 
So be kind to others and what they go through 
Because you never know when it’s your turn, 
Diabetes Mellitus is a painful lesson 
One I pray you never have to learn.”

Help me and the cats survive & stay safe,"$860 raised of $2,500 goal","Hey guys. A handful of you know what I've been going through within the past couple of years, but maybe not the fine details. I'm not exactly ready to lay them all out here, but I'll do my best to explain a bit. I escaped an extremely physically, sexually and emotionally abusive relationship about two years ago and have been on my own trying to make ends meet without much of the resources available to others, though not for lack of trying. That alone has been increasingly difficult for me due to the fact that I have no family I can trust or stay with, no real support system, cats that need taking care of, newly realized and extremely debilitating dysautonomic disorders, recently diagnosed autism, and a laundry list of other chronic and mental things I've really been struggling with. I've been trying my best to manage despite not being able to afford more than one or two of my medications every once in a while and barely making rent for months in a row after losing work and my support system. I'm more or less trying to do this all by myself, aside from those of you who have been helping me along so far. For that, for those of you, I am extremely extremely grateful. I finally found somewhere safe to live, but I really need help paying for my stay and general expenses like food, medication, and things that the cats need to remain healthy and fed. Please donate whatever you can to help me until I can climb back up on my own two feet and gain some sort of self sufficiency. Thanks for taking the time to read, and please share this if you can.

Medication costs,"$738 raised of $1,500 goal","I suffered a hemorrhagic, and ischemic stroke and a brain aneurysm, also known as a brain bleed, all at the same time. Since then, I also had a slight heart attack. I'm asking for help, because my medications are so expensive. I can't afford my Parkinson's medication, or my heart medication, or even my asthma inhaler. In total, I have 13 medications that I have to take every day.

I struggle everyday, and I really try to push through. I'm just asking for help so I can continue getting my medications.

I have a hard time trying to come up with something to say and how to say it. I still have to use an app for things to be read to me and I still have to speak into the phone, because I can't read or write properly. And it's really hard to do that because I have aphasia.

I don't know what else to say, but I really hope I can get my medications, God bless you all.","Colorado Springs, CORose’s Mental Health & Drug Abuse Rehab Fund"
Starting a family through IVF,"$1,805 AUD raised of $10,000 goal","My partner and myself have been married two and half years now. In this time we tried to conceive a baby naturally but this did not happen. We turned to a gyno and with hope that fertility drugs would help our sistuation, but it didn't. We now have to turn to IVF to help us start the family that we want. We are going through IVF and we struggle afford IVF because it is too expensive, anyone going through this knows the disappointment, the pain and the loss that you go though trying, struggling with fertility and it is not something that I have ran away from, it is something that I do openly speak about. Going through IVF is not easy, the mental stress, the weight gain and body changes that throws at you. I feel like there is something wrong with me because I cant give my partner the family that he wants. There are definitely times when I walked out of the doctor’s office wanting to cry, and other times when I was like, ‘Okay, Trent everything’s looking good, it’s going to be this month!’ The waiting and waiting has been a roller coaster. After a while, when you’re not successful, you start to associate the word ‘failure’ every time you wee on a stick and it doesn’t come out right. What starts out, as a dream becomes a endeavour and the disappointment each month becomes more and more real. Whether you can donate a little that would be great, because anything donated towards this journey will be appreciate so much.

Afford intensive outpatient therapy,"$1,655 raised of $2,000 goal","Howdy! My name is KayLee (they/them) and I am fundraising to support my enrollment into an Intensive Outpatient (IOP) program to help me stabilize my emotional well-being so that I can safely and ethically continue my work as a therapist within community mental health.

In short, I have experienced a lot of big-T trauma throughout my lifetime and was never afforded the resources or the opportunities to receive the care to nurture the parts of myself that were harmed throughout those experiences. As a result, I carry a lot of residual pain and am easily activated (""triggered"") in my current role.

June 2023, I graduated from Seattle University with my Masters in Social Work and jumped head first into my role as a full-time Youth and Family Therapist within a community mental health, nonprofit organization. My caseload grew rapidly and the clients I have been able to meet and work with are experiencing a lot of similar traumas to my own past. The countertransference has activated symptoms of my Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) that became a concern to my health and well-being.

Financial assistance for long-COVID patient.,"$340 CAD raised of $4,800 goal","Introduction:

Over the course of the global pandemic I’ve suffered through the horrible effects of COVID multiple times. Despite taking all possible precautions and safety measures, this has left me with persisting symptoms without any guarantees of if or when my condition will improve. This is referred to as long-COVID and has unfortunately left me unable to work and financially support myself. After having waited an extended period of time to be accepted onto government assistance programs, I’m left a number of months behind on bills. To make matters worse, that amount I’m now receiving from the government isn’t enough to cover basic living expenses like rent, utilities, medication and food. Being unable to work due to my ongoing condition, I have no other source of income to make up this difference. Facing the imminent threat of homelessness, starvation and the inability to afford the necessary medications. For that reason I’m here asking for your assistance in making it through this difficult situation.

Rebekkah's Myasthenia Gravis Fund,"$2,750 raised of $10,000 goal","The ability to swallow food is something we all take for granted, but imagine being unable to eat a normal meal because you choke on your food. Your social life is restricted because you are less likely to go to restaurants or house parties not knowing if your ability to swallow will fail you. You need help drying your hair and preparing your food because your arms get too weak from using them. You can no longer sing like you used to or sometimes even talk without getting short of breath. From day to day you never know what you are going to be able to do and what will make you too weak. This is myasthenia gravis, or MG. Now imagine on top of all that you have expensive tests and drugs that you can’t afford. This is my wife's struggle.

Hi, my name is Jim Shrimplin and my wife, Rebekkah, has an autoimmune neuromuscular disease called myasthenia gravis. She is in need of your help. First and foremost she needs your prayers. Prayers for her healing and emotional support; she also needs you to be an answer to prayer. We need financial assistance to help pay for expensive tests and drugs. For example, one blood test can run in the neighbor of $900-$1400, not to mention all the doctor visits. Anything you can do to help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks and God bless you in advance.

Behind what you see everyday, I deal with severe Fibromyalgia and debilitating chronic migraine, weekly seizures, along with a few other chronic illnesses.

I make a tiny bit of income from my etsy shop, but I was already coming up short on bills and am having my groceries covered by my partner. Without being able to drive or work, I am stuck with no budget and no wiggle room. And I absolutely need these medications to be safe and functional in my every day life. Anything you can donate would be an absolute blessing, and would go toward the medications I need to keep the conditions at bay.

Necessities to Keep Going - Every Dollar Helps,"$910 raised of $1,500 goal","Hello, my name is Tyler Laury. I'm sure none of you know me and this is nowhere near the first fundraiser someone in need has put on this site, but I figured...I'd give it a shot. I've been struggling a lot the past couple years, ever since I had to quit my job for the sake of my mental health. The money I managed to save up kept me going for a bit, but between rising rent costs, increasing utilities, health and dental insurance, and seeking therapy and mental health assistance, it didn't last, and I'm still struggling. I've had to give up all forms of insurance as well as therapy and psychiatric care because I could no longer afford them, so I'm at an impasse.

I won't tug your heartstrings with a sob story or twist your arm, I'll just give you the truth. I need help, and to anyone who's willing to lend a hand, I'll be forever grateful. I struggle with several mental issues that have made it extremely difficult to nearly impossible for me to even try and get back into the workforce, and I took a shot in the dark by applying for SSDI, but there's no telling when that'll ever come to pass, if ever. I'm battling with an overpowering mental minefield of severe ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, combined type with predominant inattentiveness), severe GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder), extreme Major Depressive Disorder, and Bipolar-2 Disorder, as far as has been diagnosed with what little therapy and psychiatric care I've been able to pursue, as well as some severe dental issues that often keep me from smiling out of shame.

Help Boki afford her mobility aid :),"$143 raised of $1,550 goal","Hi everyone! My name is Ava, but my friends call me Boki. I hope you take the time to read about my story and if you can, assist me on my journey! Ever since the fifth grade I’ve had symptoms of EDS and POTs. On February 24th, 2023 I was finally diagnosed with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia syndrome, or POTs for short. POTs is an autonomic nervous system disorder, also referred to as Dysautonomia. It controls processes that happen automatically such as breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, digestion, sweating, shivering, and much more. My blood vessels don't tighten enough to make sure there is enough blood flow to my brain, and it pools on the bottom half of my body causing my legs to turn red or purple. My body compensates for the lack of blood by making the heart beat faster, which causes several other symptoms. To make it easier, mainly for kids to understand, some say I'm allergic to gravity! When I stand up, my heart rate goes from a resting rate of 60-90bpm to anywhere around 130-150bpm. On my bad days, before medication, it would even get up to 180bpm! When I'm sitting, I have to frequently lay upside down so the blood in my legs and stomach go to my brain. My body prioritizes my brain, so it takes the blood from my hands and feet leaving them ice cold and painful. My blood pressure can get as high as 155/111 and then plummet to numbers like 90/80 which causes me to pass out. Since the discovery of this I’ve been put on beta blockers which helps in lowering my heart rate and blood pressure. This medicine helps, but its not a cure. Doing activities like taking out trash, doing laundry, showering, and climbing up the stairs is still a huge struggle for me.

Veteran Marine Needs Your Help,"$1,970 raised of $7,500 goal","My dad, Jimmy Ussery, is in dire financial need to afford his life sustaining medicine to treat hyponatremia (low sodium), SIADH specifically.  This medicine is costly.  The medicine, SAMSCA, is classified as a Tier 5 and RX plans only cover a percentage of the cost.  His out of pocket expense for this year will be approximately $7,500 (equates to about $625 a month).  With this daily medicine and doctor’s care, he can manage this disease and live almost normal.   Without the daily medicine his life would end. 

He has exhausted all financial resources fighting for his life; even to the point of forgoing necessities and household repairs.  Currently, he is living without HVAC; just one of the depressing realities he is faced with.  But, like a stubborn Marine, he is trying his best to make the most of a bad situation.

You may ask why doesn’t he just go to the VA?  Well, sadly he DOESN’T qualify for medical care through the VA.  Hard to believe, right?   I, like so many others, believed the VA serves all VETERANS who need medical care.  Shockingly, I found out first-hand that belief is fallacious.  I’m heartbroken knowing there are so many VETERANS in the same situation.

This battle, fighting for his life and trying to find help, has been years
(4 +) and continues.  I will spare the details and struggles to keep this plea simple and brief.   I’ve tried to no avail so many avenues,
agencies – VA & non, and the pharmaceutical company that makes the medicine.   Even out of desperation I called the White House and was redirected down yet another rabbit trail that led nowhere.

Likewise, my family collectively have exhausted all resources and maxed out credit cards.  We’re at our financial end of the rope, so to speak.  So now, our last option is to plea with the kind-hearted and compassionate American people for help.  I believe in our nation and believe Americans are true miracle workers.  Please, if you can, spare any amount of change to help us afford his medicine this year.  My dad and my family would be so, so grateful.   My dad is one of the most kind and generous souls I know.  And now, he needs some kindness and generosity in return.   He is turning 77 this month and deserves to live out his years in comfort without the constant worry about the financial burden of affording his life sustaining medication.

Thank you for your time and God bless!

Help me afford to get diagnosed with ADHD,"£140 raised of £2,500 goal","Hello! My name is Ryan, I’m a 20 year old uni student really struggling with undiagnosed ADHD. I feel like it’s genuinely ruining my life, everyone I’ve been to at uni have unofficially diagnosed me, with student support being completely sure I have it, and all of my symptoms have made it so extremely difficult for me to get through school and college, and now I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to make it through university as the coping mechanisms I have learned from school and college just are not holding up anymore. Unfortunately the waiting list for the NHS is a few years long and ADHD impacts my life so much that I feel like I won’t be able to wait that long. In order to get an official diagnosis and medication, I’ll need to go private, which costs upwards of £1500 just for diagnosis and treatment plans, not even for medication included. I am planning on using some money saved over the summer towards my diagnosis but am going to need to save as much as I can for rent and bills next year in case I can’t continue with uni (this year has been very very difficult for me and I’m pretty sure I’ve failed almost all modules) which would mean not getting any maintenance loan at all. Anything at all helps and I would be thankful for anything at all (even just moral support if you don’t want to donate) so please don’t feel obliged to donate any money :) but I am very thankful if anyone does decide to :)

prescription costs,"$1,675 raised","Hi, guys....this is a complete embarrassment for me to ask...but recently, I have been diagnosed with a DVT, a blood clot in my left leg due to a boot I did not have to wear. I have been prescribed xarelto, and once I learned about Xarelto's costs, I begged my doctor to either get me off of it or help me with samplers, to no avail.

I am a musician and an educator, and I have undertaken a big hit over the summer months due to vacation drop-offs, lost hours at my job, and now being stuck at home due to COVID. It has been challenging to keep my bills paid. Now that I am presented with this, I am now forced with having to start a fund-raiser to fund a two-month supply of Xarelto until my student schedule gets back in order or my job offers me more hours.

If I stop using Xarelto during this period, I risk a pulmonary embolism or a stroke.

"Hospital costs, prescription costs, utilities.","$400 raised of $1,500 goal","Recently I was admitted to the hospital for what I thought was pulmonary edema.  We found out it was elements of congestive heart failure.  My first visit to the hospital they admitted and kept me for a week.  They found blocked arteries,  34% heart pumping capacity,  76lbs of fluid in my chest cavity and legs and diagnosed me with diabetes type 2. During that stay they placed 5 stints in and around my heart to help the arteries that were blocked and found out that my heart was completely out of rhythm and in stroke territory.  Once I was released I was given a list of medications I need to make it through this.  I was able to get most of them except for one and have yet to be able to get it.  I was off work for another week and then put on light duty so missed out on a solid portion of my paycheck.  I went back for what I was told would be a simple in and out procedure but before the procedure they found a blood clot ready to do its thing to my heart.  They placed 4 MORE stints into me and realized they would not be able to shock my heart back into rhythm while the clot is still present.  They released me the second time and gave me an absolute shopping list of prescriptions that they require me to be on to get this handled which i absolutely cannot afford.  Rent is due, utilities are due and now I have to buy meds and pay my copays. I'm supposed to go back April 3rd to see how the clot is dissolving and need to be on these medications asap.  Any and all help will be immensely immensely appreciated and welcomed.  Even if you are unable to help please share my link around as I am in a bad way.

Diabetes Rx costs,"$1,294 raised","Hi, my name is Michael. I’ve honestly never reached out and done anything like this before for myself, but I find myself in desperation. I am currently on a prescription drug for my type 2 diabetes called Rybelsus. Many diabetes prescriptions require prior authorization from your physician, no generic versions, and very high costs. I have bounced around trying different prescriptions for years due to these issues all while my health failed to improve. Six months ago, I was put on Rybelsus which has done wonders for my health. I was able to get it at a reasonable cost due to a coupon from the manufacturer. This coupon has now changed with the start of 2023. I went to refill my prescription and was informed that even with having Blue Cross and Blue Shield along with the manufacturer coupon, my co-pay would be $1400 for a three month supply. I would love to maintain the healthy course that I am on and not change prescriptions. Thank you for reading my story and considering donating.","Mt. Pleasant, SC"

Despite being diagnosed with Lupus and MS in October 2017, my daughter Kira has struggled to maintain her employment and her role as a responsible single mother to her 10-year-old son, Bryant.

Help with medical bills after emergency,"$4,602 raised of $7,231 goal","FUNDRAISER DETAILS: A medical emergency has depleted all our savings and emergency funds. We're still struggling with the financial impact of thousands in medical bills from a severe break my daughter suffered. My 11yo daughter was playing leapfrog in the front yard with her friends. When it was her turn to leap, she fell, landed wrong and broke both bones in her left forearm. The seriousness of the break required us to take an ambulance to the emergency room. Doctors aligned one bone without much trouble, but the second bone had an S-shaped break broken in two places with shards. It needed more complicated procedures to repair. We've had to travel more than an hour from home to see a pediatric orthopedic surgeon for the operations and will have to travel more for another procedure. We've also had to pay higher copays ($75 per visit) to see her surgeon, who is considered a specialist and the added costs of various therapies, some minimally covered by insurance. The added healthcare costs, including travel, car maintenance, copays and prescription medications, have dried up our emergency funds and cleaned out savings it took years to build. This fundraiser is for funds to pay medical bills and prescription costs. This request will also help pay for other costs, including but not limited to: the city ambulance costs ($1,096), ER doctors' charge ($267), lab services ($680) and two $500 deductibles. Thanks to your generosity, we've already been able to make payments on some medical bills, but we're still trying to reach our goal. Any donation, big or small, will help. Thank you in advance for your kindness and for helping my family. We're grateful for every donation. Please donate and share this fundraiser.

I ask that no one post anything on FB as Janielle is a very private individual. 
Janelle is in dire need of an       insulin called Apidra. It is the only insulin she can take that she does not have bad side.       effects. A little over 30 days ago her insurance company       decided that they would no.    longer cover her medication. The cost is  $3000 month, a.   price they can not afford.         They have tried everything to get the price reduced to no.    avail. They have even contacted the manufacturer who.        offered a $100/month. coupon. The next step is to change    insurance companies, but that can't take place until maybe
next month, IF they can find.  one that will cover it.
Janelle has been without.           insulin for approximately a   month, which is way to long.
Her sugar levels are so high    her  reader can't gage it as it.  only goes to 900.
She is having problems seeing, can't  focus ,gets very little  sleep and is dealing with kidney problems, gets fatiged easily all due to not being able to   have her insulin do the price of her insulin. 
With her sugar counts being so out of control she could go into a diabetic coma and possibly die.

medication cost for prostate cancer,"$3,725 raised of $5,000 goal","As many of you know, my husband, Tony, was first diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2006 and for 10 years after that it remained under control.  He was diagnosed again with the return of the prostate cancer in March 2016.  Recently his doctor at Memorial Sloan Kettering, Basking Ridge, N.J. prescribed a strong cancer medication called Zytiga, which has no generic for now.  The cost of the medication is over $9000 per month ,but is not covered by our Medicare Part D Prescription Plan. The doctor called a few places and got CVS Special Care Pharmacy to get it for us at a cost of $2575 for a one month supply.

We are presently attempting to apply to the manufacturer of the medication, Johnson & Johnson, for financial assistance, but there is no guarantee if and when the application might be approved, or if gets approved at all.  In the meantime, any help will be appreciated just to get him started on the medication as soon as we can.  Our thanks to anyone who would consider helping.

Cancer Prescription Drug Costs,"$5,345 CAD raised of $6,000 goal","After much deliberation, I am asking my network of family and friends for support in meeting unexpected drug costs related to my recent cancer treatments. As many of you already know I was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer in early January of this year. I had surgery in February and presently I'm on two rounds of chemotherapy . I finished  four cycles of the first drugs on June 26th and I start the next drugs in three weeks.
I have been reasonably fortunate with chemo side effects mainly experiencing fatigue and shortness of breath. I have received prescriptions for some very good drugs to keep nausea and GI problems at bay.

The shortness of breath symptom however became progressively more troublesome and my oncologist ordered a chest CT scan last week and it showed several small pulmonary emboli. Blood clots can be a side effect of chemotherapy. I have been started on injectable Fragmin, an anti-coagulant that I inject myself with daily for the next several months. It is the only anti-coagulant that I can use during my treatment.

Unfortunately, my extended Health care coverage with Blue Cross has been used up for this year due in part to the expensive drugs I have already received for side effects. British Columbia Pharmacare will not help with costs of prescriptions until I surpass a high deductible. Fragmin is a very expensive drug that will cost me out of pocket $1,260 a month which is 40% of my net income. I have explored all avenues with the BC Cancer agency for any other ways to help with this cost and there are none. That is why I am initiating this Gofundme campaign to help pay for this expensive but very necessary drug.

A bit about myself. I am a retired registered nurse and my entire nursing career I worked in northern Canada. My nursing spanned from remote outpost nursing stations to a staff nurse for over 25 years at Whitehorse  General Hospital in the Yukon. My speciality was Pediatrics but I was able to work in many areas of this small wonderful northern hospital.

I have enjoyed good health all my life until recently and now I have a much better understanding of being a patient rather the health care provider.

It is difficult to ask family and friends to contribute but it is an extraordinary circumstance and hopefully only temporary. Any extra funds contributed over my goal will be used for any other required prescriptions drugs I may require.

My breast cancer battle continues after the chemo with further surgery late fall and then radiation. I feel very positive about beating this and that I will be healthy and strong with a full head of hair by this time next year!

Thank you from the bottom of my heart!

Help Activist Hank Adams' Prescription/Life Costs,"$5,400 raised of $3,000 goal","There is no retirement plan for activists, even activists as necessary to human rights/Native people/the Treaty Rights fight as Hank Adams has always been.  Adams' was a part of the original activism that was the spark that lit the fire of Alcatraz and Wounded Knee and continues to burn with Native resistance worldwide.  From somehow getting Marlon Brando and Dick Gregory to stand in solidarity with Native people over treaty rights--even to the point of getting arrested in solidarity--to marching with Martin Luther King, Jr. and helping draft the 21 Point Position Paper that was the infrastructure of The Trail of Broken Treaties, Adams has directly affected every single Native Nation and Native person.  Adams' activism caused Vine Deloria Jr. to call him the most important Indian of the past 60 years.

Now, after devoting his entire lifetime to Native nations, Native sovereignty and Native people, Adams' health is, quite frankly, not good. He's pretty much homebound and not able to get out to lecture or otherwise generate revenue right now.  We hope that his health recovers so that he can continue to provide his big ideas and guidance. In order to do that, Adams has a pretty hefty list of prescriptions he must be able to meet. In addition to the prescriptions, he just needs a little bit extra as he has to relocate from his home to another home. He has his usual rent, but because he has not been able to generate any income, he will struggle mightily with the deposit and first and last month's rent.  All of that combined will add up to approximately $2800 dollars, but I just rounded up to $3000 because...heck, in exchange for his lifetime of service  he deserves to have a little bit extra to buy some smokes or some gas money.

I've never put together one of these fundraisers in my life and would not do so unless it was for someone who helped make this world a better place for us all; Hank Adams is one such individual.  Thank you much.

"Medical, Prescription, Gas costs","$430 raised of $5,000 goal","Hello, if you don't already know me, My name is Camron Tebbe I'm 24, and I have just recently been diagnosed with Lynch syndrome as well as Colon Cancer in the sigmoid section of my large intestine. Currently I will be going through surgery on the 17th of October 2023 to have a majority of my large intestine removed and hope that the cancer doesn't come back.
I'm only doing this GoFundme because I don't have a way to work till after I'm healed and the doctors say I'm allowed to return to working (which I believe may be up to 2 months), so this will help pay for any medical costs that my medical insurance may not cover throughout the treatment I'll be going through, also to cover any medicine (which they've have already stopped covering some of it) and any gas used to travel back and fourth between doctors visits. (If you would like to know more feel free to DM me)
Anything will help, and Definitely don't send anything if you can't afford too.
Thank you in advance.","Bonney Lake, WA"

Ongoing Cancer-related costs for Kenny Peters,"$5,425 raised of $15,000 goal","Hi, my name is Kenny Peters and in November of 2023, I was diagnosed with kidney cancer. I am also diabetic and my A1C was at a very dangerous 20.1, creating a delay in immediate surgery. I have been able to get my blood sugar under control quickly with several medications, and the surgery is now scheduled for January 23rd, 2024. I do not have prescription insurance and am currently on 8 medications daily. I will lose several weeks of work (I only work part-time as it is) and the medication costs are already overwhelming to the budget. The continued need for medications, the copays for surgery itself, and the loss of income for that time while recovering are looming greatly and I'm turning to this avenue for helping to ease those losses. The tumor will likely be close to Stage 3 by the time surgery is here as it has grown very fast. The 5-year expectancy for Stage 1 is 95-98%, Stage 2 drops that down to 73%, and Stage 3's expectancy drops to between 40 & 70%. At this time a partial nephrectomy is planned but I am prepared that I will lose the whole left kidney. Any help you can contribute to this will be greatly appreciated and help keep my needed medications available as well as utilities and food, rent, etc.","Austin, TX"

In early September at just 33 years old our sister Ketsia Erra Kendall was dealt a devastating blow – she was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia. For the past three years, she has worked tirelessly as a cardiac nurse and patient advocate, earning several Daisy Awards for superior nursing excellence.

A few weeks ago, he passed away from respiratory failure resulting from a fall that left him ""paralyzed"". It is currently under investigation. To say we are still stunned is an understatement. Gracious family members immediately stepped in and paid for the cremation. But the overall financial issue has been unexpected. There was no life insurance, no savings, no assets, only social security. We recently learned that she will only be able to keep his amount which isn't even enough to pay rent where she currently lives. I have her on multiple wait lists for housing, which could take up to a year, and social services won't approve anything for at least 3 months. While the need will not be ongoing, it is immediate.

Lila's Emergency Treatment,"$5,498 raised of $5,466 goal","Hello all,
I am writing today in the hopes that I may gain some support in covering the emergency surgery for my tiny goblin of a cat, Lila. Symptoms of bladder stones appeared early Sunday and I rushed her to an emergency veterinary hospital in Manhattan, where they told me she needs life saving surgery to clear the obstruction. They informed me it is very rare for young female cats to develop stones, but here we are. This comes with an almost devastating hospital bill totaling $8,434.72. This, including the initial exam cost, as well as medications for after the surgery, I simply have no current means to cover it. I would do anything for Lila, so I will find the means no matter what. But if my community has anything to spare to help shoulder the burden of this cost I would be forever indebted to you. Thank you for your time.

Assistance with medical cost..,"$3,578 raised of $4,500 goal","My name is Chandler, I was diagnosed a little while ago with a rare disease called Keratoconus.. Keratoconus is a progressive degenerative eye disease that affects the corneas. A normal cornea is shaped like a smooth dome where as a keratotic eye causes the cornea to budge out in the shape of a cone making vision nearly impossible. This is a disease in which regular prescription eyeglasses and contacts cannot correct. There is no cure for this disease. There are however treatments and steps I can take to try and save my vision, and that is what has brought me here...to go fund me to ask for any help at all. The first ideal step in treatment is a process called Corneal Cr3 Crosslinking, Crosslinking is a process in which the outer layer of my eye is scrapped off and given vitamin rich drops known as Riboflavin or Vitamin B2. Once the eye has fully absorbed the Riboflavin it is then strengthened by UV lasers that start a chemical reaction to secure the bonds of the cornea. This does not reverse the damage already caused in my eye but ideally halts progression. Following a Successful CXL treatment I would then have monthly check ups with my specialist to be fitted with Scleral lenses that I Will need for the rest of my life. Usually I am a strong person but this diagnosis has totally crippled me and for once I can say I have fear and anxiety and little hope with this condition. Despite that it can be treated, I know the progression for others is different. In my left eye I can no longer be fitted with any prescription glasses....This sickness has completely gutted me. My eyes really were everything to me, from making videos, to gaming with my friends, riding my bike, creating art...this has made me feel helpless. I am not one to ask for help, but this time I really need help...from anyone that is willing, able, kind enough to help. That could be money, testimonies, words of encouragement, anything at all. The medical cost for my lenses cost upwards of $1000 dollars, and Crosslinking surgery cost $1500-$6000 on average. not to mention the time I have had to spend with doctors away from work. Quite frankly I am struggling and I am afraid. Anything would help. Thank you for taking the time to even read this. I wish you the best...

He is now home waiting to start chemo on Wednesday. 

The tumor is too large to operate at this point and the plan is to skink it with chemo and radiation before surgery to remove it.  He is in constant pain and Medicaid has not kicked in.

Rosie's Chemo Treatment,"$6,800 raised of $6,800 goal","On February 23rd, my mom was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia. With daily chemo medication her cancer can be treated, but never cured. Without the medication her life expectancy will be a just a few years compared to the 10 she could have. Methodist covered the cost of her first month of treatment while we applied to different foundations for financial support. She just finished her 30 day prescription and no financial aid has come through for the next months supply. The cost of one month of chemo medication is $3000 with insurance. I'm hoping to raise the cost for two months of medication while we wait to hear from organizations that provide help for cancer treatment. 

If you know me, you know how hard it is for me to ask for help but I've done everything I can. I'm currently working 7 days a week trying to save money to pay for my mom's next month of medication. No one ever deserves cancer, but it feels particularly unfair that it's Rosie. For everyone that has been lucky enough to know her, she's an angel. ( Quite the opposite of myself) She raised me as a single parent for almost all of my life and I never went without. More importantly, I have never gone a day without knowing how much she loves me. Through all the ups and downs in my life she has always been there, and I would like to do the same for her.

Help me from drowning in personal and medical debt,"$2,511 raised of $4,000 goal","Earlier this year, I reported that my major spinal surgery cost $217. Unfortunately, that was just the first bill. Besides being saddled with another $1,500 in surgical costs, I've had costs from prescription and non-prescription remedies, my other ongoing illnesses, and prescribed physical and mental therapeutic services.

The cost of treatment was only amplified by the fact that I was also unable to work for 9 months while waiting for and recovering from my surgery. And now that I'm back in school, I'm also working fewer hours than before so I can focus on my studies, which I think is the right decision, as I have been able to excel, and have been able to earn a scholarship to cover tuition costs.

I am making a little bit of money again, working in the tutoring center at my college. But all this combined means my debt is only growing and getting harder to pay down each month. Your donation will help me put this chapter of my life behind me, so I can focus on growing into the kind of person who is able to support others instead.

If you yourself are currently in debt, please do not donate to my campaign. I don't want to spread my debt around. But if you want to help me out regardless, please share my campaign with your circle. Others you know may be in a better position to donate!

Thank you so much. Anything you can give—whether a monetary donation, sharing the campaign, or just a message to my inbox if we haven't talked in a while—would mean a lot to me.

Help Me Walk Freely Again (medical bills),"$1,600 AUD raised","TL;DR in order to regain mobility and free myself from debilitating chronic pain, I need to raise AU$1358 to see a pain specialist (AU$480) and have a nerve root injection in my spine (medical procedure, AU$878) to relieve pressure on a nerve and spinal cord so I can begin physical rehabilitation. The ultimate goal is to improve my health enough to wean off my prescription painkillers and be able to walk without a cane.

After an accident 8 years ago which left me with a fractured vertebra, bulging/ruptured disks and sciatica, I’ve dealt with life altering chronic pain on a daily basis. Over the last 2 years I’ve also developed severe muscular
atrophy which has rendered my body incapable of supporting its own weight and furthering the damage to my spine. As a result I’ve lost mobility in the left side of my body, I’m unable to work and my university department co-ordinater has even urged me to defer until my health improves (which would be absolutely heartbreaking if I had to defer my studies). 

Currently I’m on a ridiculously large dose of prescription pain killers per day which are slowly destroying my organs, and I’m at a high risk for physical dependency. This alone would be another life shattering problem to face.

Share or Donate to help Brad,"$2,640 raised of $5,000 goal","Hi, my name is Monica Grove and I am creating this page requesting donations, positive affirmations, and prayers for my family- especially my husband Brad.

He will be using a walker and needs a smaller bed to be able to ambulate in the bedroom to get to and from the bathroom. Any donations will go towards these immediate needs of his and expenses associated with his continued care. Thank you all for sharing and caring, your support is greatly appreciated.","Houston, TX"
Help MHC Senior Afford Dental Care!,$800 raised,"Hi, I am a current Mount Holyoke senior who is in need of raising funds for my dental care. Last week, I went to a dentist for an emergency appointment due to pain and found that I will likely need more dental work performed, such as a wisdom tooth extraction. I was given a prescription for the pain and may possibly have an infection. I am currently uninsured for dental, as my coverage expired when I turned 20 and my health insurance will not be able to help. It’s been a very stressful experience and I would be grateful for any help so I can afford my health. My first appointment was $250 and my next appointment cost breakdown is as follows:
exam- $186
full cleaning- $190

Suzanne's Support Fund,"$3,000 CAD raised of $5,000 goal","Hey everyone,

One of our fellow coworkers, Suzanne, has recently taken very ill and as a result has been off work and in the hospital. At this time the doctors are still working to diagnose the nature of her illness, but based on their findings thus far, it's looking like it's going to be a long road to recovery.

Anyone who knows Suzanne knows that she is a very kind, good-natured person. She's always been there for us and our employees, and she could really use our support in her time of need.

I'd ask that anyone who knows Suzanne consider contributing to helping her through this very difficult time. Anything you might be able to offer would be both helpful and appreciated.

Help the helper,"$2,649 raised of $10,000 goal","I am raising money to help my friend Michelle with sudden veterinary expenses for her sweet cat Moose.

Michelle is retired from her career in social work and has a fixed income. Since retirement she has fostered, socialized, and facilitated the adoption of feral kittens. Some of these kittens have required special care or longer than usual fostering.
She is always finding ways to care for her community - offering friendship, transportation, picking up groceries, etc.
She also supports the homeless in her community, facilitating their access to needed services, providing transportation, and some financial support. For example she helped a young pregnant woman get off the steeets and into a program that is allowing her to keep and care for her baby while she learns the skills and obtains the housing she needs to provide for her child.

Help with costs of dental emergency,$240 raised of $750 goal,"Hi, I'm Keri. I'm 30 years old, and mother to two beautiful girls. I'm asking for help with raising funds to receive emergency dental care. I was supposed to have all 4 wisdom teeth removed in 2011, but my insurance was terminated when i turned 19, and i was unable to have them removed. I managed to have one extracted in January of 2022, but still need 3 others extracted, in addition to a molar.

My top right wisdom tooth has fully erupted, but all of the exposed tooth has completely broken off and is still crumbling away. A broken tooth is bad enough to deal with, but a tooth broken at/beneath the gum line is waay worse, and it is potentially dangerous. I am in excruciating pain. I can't smile, it hurts to eat. I feel the pain in my entire face. I'm currently taking prescription pain medicine as well as OTCs and antibiotics, and No medications are helping. I know i will only find relief if I have the wisdom tooth extracted, as well as my first molar. I can't manage the pain anymore and i am desperate for help. Emergency dental clinics in my area, and roughly a 2 hour radius, don't accept medicaid, and i cannot afford the cost on my own.

Stoneys veterinary bill,$185 raised,"Hi, I’m Ashton and I’m raising this money so I can pay for my cats vet bill. This was very unexpected, and unfortunately seems to be something you have to worry about with male cats. Stoney is a 5 year old neutered male cat that I have had since he was 8 weeks old, his birthday is actually tomorrow. 4/04. He is also FIV+. He started squatting this morning and nothing was coming out. I called his vet and they told me it was urgent I bring him in immediately. He has a urinary blockage, they placed the catheter and he seems to be doing okay so far…they don’t believe he has any damage to his kidneys and I caught it in time. He has to be there for a minimum 3 days, I have already gone to visit since I brought him there this morning. There is a local organization that is helping with half the cost, the estimate of everything is $825 but there could be addition costs with medications, ect. I will also have to have him on a prescription urinary food for the rest of his life. I’m asking $500 to cover the rest of the cost, food, and fees from gofundme. You could also just directly pay toward the bill to the veterinary clinic. Fort Oglethorpe Pet Wellness Center.

Medical cost for out of pocket max 2023.,"$3,270 raised of $4,000 goal","July 2023 changed my daughters life and has challenged our family. In a blink of an eye independence was taken from her. 3 hospitals and close to 3 wks in the hospital and the diagnoses are coming in. If it is rare…. It’s going to happen to her. West Nile Virus has decided she was a perfect/non-perfect host. Sadly she was not the 1 in 5 to get just the fever and brush it off. She is the 1 in 150 who developed a serious illness affecting her central nervous system. Recovery from severe illness might take several weeks or months. Some effects to the central nervous system might be permanent. Brittany is a fighter. She does her best to take a few steps throughout the day, however the electric wheelchair has been a life saver. The 20+ weight loss has come with malnourishment by severe nausea, loss of smell and taste. Weakness with all her limbs go in sync with her nerves firing all over her body, day and night along with numbness, muscle spasms that are uncomfortable, neuropathy, sever pain, and lack of coordination. She has developed 6th nerve palsy and has been wearing an eye patch and dark prescription sunglasses due to double vision, blurred vision and sometimes loss of vision with elevated spinal fluid pressure. Her last day of work is a distant memory 7/24/23 and on that note the virus has affected her cognition, memory loss, concentration, and difficulty saying what she is thinking. So many of you have offered support in prayer, wheelchairs, offered meal trains, however we as a family were on day by day mode with so many unknowns. There still are so many unknowns as to there is no vaccine or cure for West Nile Virus we are to just treat the symptoms. With 20 medications, Neuro Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, neurology, physiatry, primary care provider, and so many wonderful people who help with referrals, emergency calls, mychart notes and our frantic calls as we work through the new normal with each lab test brought us down the rabbit hole as Brittany calls it. With the summer stolen from her and her children we finished Friday with 2 doctors appointments and scoped up her and family that were able to go and headed to Yellowstone. What an adventure for all. But for me as a mom it was overwhelming to my heart to see her husband Corey and 2 children Charlie and AJ go into love and caring mode. It was not an easy trip. What is wheelchair accessible? I have a feeling this will be a passion of hers when she is able to advocate. How can we support Brittany and her family has been asked by so many of you. During our 20 plus hours her and I have had some difficult talks and she is open for support. Whether it be by prayers, private messages, calls, a quick meal, or financial assistance to help cover her out of pocket max of $4,000 for the year 2023 we are and continue to be humbled with your support as she pushes on to her path of healing.

Ayaansh Needs Expensive Drug. You Are Last Hope!!,"$244,903 raised","**Cost of the drug is over $2.1 USD million**
*$1 USD million goal in campaign running in gofundme, over $215k USD collected*
*$2.1 USD million goal in campaign running in India, over $1.7 million USD collected http://impactguru.com/s/aHvvEr*
Ayaansh fights SMA 27th May 2018- the happiest day in the life of Rupal and Yogesh Gupta, the day their son was born. With tears of happiness in their eyes, they named their kid Ayaansh. As their lives began with their new addition to the family, at around 6 months of age, they realized that little Ayaansh was missing the milestones which were usually achieved by other kids his age. He hadn’t started crawling or wasn’t sitting up. They started reading about why this could be happening and thought that it would just be a normal delay and eventually it would happen. Little did they know that something far more severe is happening in their son’s body.



When he didn’t have the control to even hold up his neck at 8 months of age, the parents were worried and took him to Rainbow Children’s Hospital. There, after countless consultations and appointments with multiple specialists, the parents found out that Ayaansh is suffering from SMA, a life-limiting condition where for the majority of children (approximately 95%) life expectancy is less than 18 months. “We felt our lives were shattered when the doctors said that he will not live for more than 4-6 years.”

Currently, Ayaansh is of 2 years and 8 months of age and has a chest deformation called pigeon’s chest. He requires physiotherapy daily for at least 4-5 hours. Completely on a liquid diet, he is unable to swallow properly and on a good day he throws up whatever he eats twice. On an average day, he vomits around 5 times. He needs BiPAP support for breathing for 12 hours a day and often suffers from sleep apnea. Even when he has a cough the little boy needs a tube i.e. catheter to remove the phlegm.

There is only a ray of hope for the little boy, the world’s most expensive medicine – Zolgensma. This is the ideal time for little Ayaansh to take the medicine as it is only approved for children who have a bodyweight of fewer than 13.5 kilograms. Ayaansh’s weight is 10 kilograms. But the world’s most expensive medicine is not possible to arrange for a middle-class couple like the Guptas. 16 crores is an impossible amount to arrange.

Rise Up for Rhys,"$403,470 raised of $500,000 goal","Baby Rhys was diagnosed with SMA at 6 months old and needed a life saving drug that cost $2.1 million. She was able to get Zolgensma in August of 2020 and has responded well to the treatment. Thankfully, much of the cost of this expensive drug was covered by insurance. Funds raised here will continue to go towards the many remaining costs for Rhys’s ongoing care including co-pays and deductibles, doctors visits, physical therapy, mobility equipment, ADA adjustments to the Devine’s home to accommodate and supports Rhys’s mobility, and to continue to spread awareness of SMA so that other babies receive diagnosis and treatment before it’s too late. Thank you for your support. Follow Rhys’s story and current updates on Instagram @RiseUpForRhys

In May of 2019 while on vacation in Scotland, Rory and I found out we were pregnant (though I already knew - mother’s intuition kicks in early!)  Our baby girl was due on Christmas Day, and after a perfectly healthy pregnancy and 20 hours of labor, we welcomed her 3 weeks early on December 4, 2019 at 12:13pm. Even though I had sworn not to give my children confusing-to-pronounce Welsh names as my mother had done to me, we decided to name her Rhys (pronounced Reese).


Rhys had been a healthy baby, loving her baths, walks outside, and cuddles and kisses from her doggies. As Rhys approached 4 months, that mother’s intuition was nagging me - I noticed that she seemed to be falling behind on milestones other babies her age were hitting. She always struggled with tummy time, and wasn’t able to roll over or hold her head up for very long. At her 4 month check up, our pediatrician said she just had low muscle tone and recommended physical therapy. a genetic condition we had never heard of before. 


A quick Google search, confirmed every parent’s greatest fear: ""The number 1 genetic disease that kills most babies up to 2 years old."" Appointments with Geneticists and Pediatric Neuro-muscular Specialists were set, blood and saliva tests ordered, and the waiting began. We hoped it was something else less severe, easier to treat, less devastating. ANYTHING but SMA. After 2 weeks, the longest 2 weeks of our lives, we received the heartbreaking diagnosis - Rhys has SMA Type 1, the most severe form of the disease.


SMA is a terminal muscle degenerative disease, affecting eating, speaking, moving and even breathing. It results in muscle wasting where infants often die of respiratory failure before reaching the age of two. It is so rare that just a few years ago, there was no treatment. Parents had to watch as their child was able to move less and less, becoming unable to eat and breath on their own.

One treatment, SPINRAZA, works on the SMN2 gene, which is a less active copy of the SMN1 gene (the gene that is missing/non-functioning in a person with SMA). By boosting production of SMN2, SPINRAZA supports muscle development and provides a level of improvement. SPINRAZA is very expensive at $750K in the first year and $375K every year thereafter for life. In August of 2019, a new gene therapy, ZOLGENSMA was approved by the FDA. It replaces the missing/non-functioning SMN1 gene with a new functional copy. This medicine provides life changing improvement, some patients are even able to walk independently. Such a miracle drug comes at a cost, and ZOLGENSMA is the most expensive drug in the world at $2.1 million USD.


Because SMA Type 1 is aggressive and degenerative, this is a race against time. With each day that passes, motor neurons in Rhys’ sweet little body are becoming inactive. All funds raised will go to Rhys’s medical care including gene therapy (out-of-pocket responsibility outside of insurance not known at this time), physical and occupational therapy, mobility and development equipment, etc. She has a lifetime ahead of her and will need continuous treatment for the best chance at a full life. In the case there are additional funds beyond Rhys’s needs, they will go to Cure SMA, an organization dedicated to raising awareness for this devastating disease. 

Every child should have the best possible chance at life - please join us to surround our happy little girl in love and support.

World's costliest drug is Rehansh's only hope,"$46,636 raised of $2,100,000 goal","Imagine if you woke up in the middle of the night. You wish to move but you can’t, no matter how much you try. Sounds scary right? Sadly this is the condition of 9-month-old Rehansh who has Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1. The day he was diagnosed, a price was stamped on the child’s life.





It is a genetic disease affecting the entire nervous system, peripheral nervous system, and hence voluntary muscle movement. Maximum nerve cells that control muscles are located in the spinal cord, which accounts for the word spinal in the name of the disease. 







Our Motive is to give him a Fulfilling and Long Lifespan, but the cost of which is something we cannot bear. So does that mean we will lose our child?

We all need to come together in his fight against SMA and donate whatever possible to reach this goal as soon as possible, because time is very crucial since Zolgensma can only sold and administered to patients less than 2 years. Rehansh needs this treatment urgently and we need your help, support, and prayers to save him from a battle he is fighting everyday for his life.

Please find Rehansh's complete medical report here -



Please donate whatever you can spare. Every donation will count towards saving Rehansh and giving him a chance at living a good and fulfilling life. Alone the parents cannot bear to save little Rehash but together it is not impossible. The times are hard for everyone, and we're forever grateful for your help. Even if you're unable to donate, please share this as much as you can on social media and make this miracle happen.

We are in for the long haul in our fight against this deadly disease. The best course of action is to raise awareness and get the necessary infrastructure set up to reduce the cost of treatment. Only time and continuous lobbying will contribute to long-lasting change.

One of the best feelings in the world is Saving a Life. Your donation will not only help our son live his life but will help us preserve our Family. Thank you all in advance for your support and contributions. We're forever grateful to you all.

Help James get his medicine.,"$1,705 raised of $1,685 goal","Hi everyone I’m fundraising for myself, usually I am not the kind of person to ask for help from anyone, especially when it comes to finances, however; over the last 8 months my whole life has changed dramatically. I was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis in July 2021, an auto-immune disease which a percentage of people with psoriasis will develop. This disease causes my immune system to fight my own joints and eventually if left untreated, can cause disability. On top of that my skin psoriasis isn’t much better covering most of my body. I’ve learned a lot through this journey about this disease and how to treat it. I have spent lots of money that I don’t have seeing every doctor I could to try and figure this out and help me get through it, and through that process I have found myself in some medical debt, but this isn’t why I’ve created this fundraiser. I created this fundraiser to pay for my medicine I need desperately to treat this disease. Cosentyx is an injectable biological drug that is one of the most expensive if not the most expensive drug there is, and it is my only real shot of getting back to an active lifestyle, waking up without pain, straightening my knee, lifting my arms in the air, being able to walk most days. Thankfully I have insurance which will cover most of the $9,000 a month cost of this drug. The only problem is I need to pay my deductible in whole before they will agree to pay for it, which is why I am here. I can pay my own medical bills and work on that in my own time, but I have been waiting to get this medicine for almost a year at this point and it would be life changing to be able to finally use it. Again I don’t typically enjoy asking for help, but if anyone feels generous enough to help me get back to a normal-ish life, I would be incredibly grateful to say the least.

Ryan's Chemo Cost,"$4,165 raised of $75,000 goal","Hi.  First let me thank you for taking time to read this and considering donating to our cause!  I want to tell you a little something about an amazing kid I know and love.  My friend's son, Ryan, is 9 years old.  He is a fun, loving, and caring guy who has truly taught me a lot in the time I've known him.  I have learned more about my daughter and myself from him.  He brightens up the room when he walks in it and greets you with a giant smile and hug.  He is one of my daughter's best friends.  She is 6, and he plays with her and watches out for her like a big brother.  Once, to make her happy he danced with her in the kitchen after dinner (which was a selfless act because the boy really doesn't like to dance).  He's an incredible kid!

Ryan, or as his family calls him, ""Rhino,"" was recently diagnosed with a rare form of cancer called chronic myelogenous leukemia.  The prognosis looks good for Ryan, but the only drug that can be used for his treatment costs $600 a day.  The doctors think that he will need to be on the medication for at least 2 years.  That's roughly $438,000 for medication alone.  It would mean a lot to him and his family if you could help.  Without treatment, the doctors give Ryan an estimate of 2-5 years of life.  Any little bit can help Ryan.  Thank you for your donation, and please spread the word.

EMMA's LETTER
____________________________

I will never forget the first time I saw Nika’s eyes. She smiled at us almost right away.
Motherhood is a deep thing, it’s another dimension of caring and loving.

I remember the day of her diagnosis clearly. It got dark, cold, and sticky in the room… I remember the doctor's lips moving in slow-motion saying that Nika has Spinal Muscular Atrophy.  The more he was explaining the darker and stickier it was getting in the room.

My soul hurt, I had words and tears boiling in my throat. But I had no time to feel as we had to stay strong and act fast, Nika needs to start her treatment immediately. Because every day counts, every moment, every motor neuron.

Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease, which causes progressive loss of muscle strength that affects the ability to move, swallow, and breathe.

As the geneticist explained, in simple words, each of us (my husband and I) have one defective/mutated survival gene of motor neurons 1 (SMN1). This gene is responsible for the production of a protein that controls our muscles.





____________________________________________________

We need the support of volunteers who can help us during this fight. We refuse to give up as we have Nika's beaming eyes looking at us with love.

World's costliest drug for baby Ayansh,"€2,174 raised of €500,000 goal","Update 1 :-
Dear Donors
Thank you very much for your generous contributions towards Baby Ayansh. A few weeks ago the mere thought of arranging Rs 16 crores sent shivers down our spine. However, your outpour of love and support has turned that fear into faith as now we believe that Ayansh’s life will be saved with the help of kind souls like you. 
Ayansh has to do physiotherapy on a regular basis. This is very important for him as he has to maintain the remaining muscle function he has. 
———————————
Ayansh's CONDITION

My cousin, baby Ayansh, at a very early age, is diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy. The disorder attacks the baby’s nerves and muscles, and as it progresses, makes it extremely difficult for them to carry out basic activities like sit up, lift their head, swallow milk, and even breathe.




SMA affects 1 in 10,000 babies and is the #1 genetic cause of infant death worldwide.




We, as Ayansh's parents, want to give him, a lively and happy childhood, his best chance to not only survive but also live a fulfilled, long and normal life.

As of now, there are no treatment options available in India for this invisible killer. Our only hope for Ayansh to have a normal life is to be able to import Zolgensma, a one-time gene replacement therapy, which in his current state could be a potential “cure”.




Zolgensma comes at a steep cost of INR 16 crores (USD $2.1 million).




WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP

Donate money. Please donate with your heart so we can save our Ayansh's life.
Contribute your time. We are in for the long haul in our fight against this deadly disease. The best course of action is to raise awareness and get the necessary infrastructure set up in India. Only time and continuous lobbying will contribute to long-lasting change.
Spread the word. Healthy parents could have a genetically affected baby. Genetic testing is in a nascent state in India, with limited labs and clinics available for diagnosis. Tell others about genetic testing, so this becomes a common practice as it is in most western countries like USA and Canada, where genetic screening is part of post-natal care.

Please help Nanette get her cancer drug.,"$26,350 raised of $20,000 goal","My name is Bob Boyd and I'm fundraising for my friend who has cancer. Nanette Sample needs a very expensive, specialized cancer drug called Tagrisso.

Nanette was diagnosed with stage 4 adenocarcinoma (lung cancer) in May of 2022. By the time it was found, it had already spread to her bones, liver, and brain, however after doctors put her on Tagrisso, improvement was noticeable within weeks. Tagrisso passes the blood/brain barrier, making it helpful even for the cancer in her brain.

Until September, she had been in full remission. However, the company originally sponsoring Tagrisso changed their rules and dropped her and others. She is in the process of obtaining both financial assistance and new insurance to help with the enormous cost of this drug, but that process takes time. It's time Nanette doesn't have.

A Cure for Jeremy,"$2,904 raised","My son, Jeremy, has hepatitis C. He is an amazing young man and the father of two of my grandchildren. Seeing the patient and loving father he is to my grandchildren makes me so proud.
He is a very hard worker helping to change the lives of others through his work in helping to improve treatment options, circumstances and modalities for those suffering with alcohol and drug addiction.
The hep C, however, threatens his life, but, thank God, a cure is available through the amazing work and efforts of scientists and drug companies.. The cost of research etc...makes the drug very expensive, to the tune of $90,000 plus. Jeremy acquired insurance and was prescribed the medication, but his insurance declined to pay because he wasn’t at a severe enough stage of the disease to meet their requirements for payment, but his last evaluation was 4 years ago. His symptoms have increased causing great concern for his health. For those not familiar, the disease ultimately destroys the liver, requiring a liver transplant, but even those receiving a transplant have an average of 5 additional years.
All that said, we have researched and have several alternatives which he can pursue. They should be between $10-20,000. This is for a 95-100% cure rate.
This is why I started this campaign. Jeremy and myself, as well as all his family and friends will be forever grateful for whatever anyone can do to help.

Thanks,

Help baby Crew’s fight with SMA,"$69,023 raised of $2,100,000 goal","Crew Delia was born on May 6, 2021 and was perfect and healthy as could be. 

On May 18th, Crew’s parents received a phone call that they will never forget. Their perfect baby boy was diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) through newborn screening.
Spinal muscular atrophy is a rare genetic neuromuscular disease that slowly kills motor nerve cells in the body and affects the muscles used for activities such as sitting, standing, walking, breathing and swallowing.
It is the number one genetic killer of infants under the age of two years old and affects 1 in 11,000 babies born each year.

Through confirmative testing at Children’s Hospital in Jackson, MS, Crew was officially diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy. Although he is not showing symptoms currently, without treatment he will not be able to walk on his own and may require feeding and/or breathing support in the future.

Thankfully, there is a recent (2019) FDA approved one time IV infusion Zolgensma that essentially replaces the gene he is missing with a new, working copy of the gene and stops the progression of SMA. With this treatment, it is hopeful that Crew will be achieving developmental milestones like crawling and walking on a normal timeline that a non SMA child would.

Chemo Medication for Anne Leatherman,"$22,245 raised of $15,000 goal","This fundraiser is for my badass mother Anne Leatherman. As many of you know her 2020 experience during a pandemic has been extra tumultuous. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in January for the 2nd time. She is a breast cancer survivor however it came back 16 years later. She has been through the ringer with scans, labs, multiple doctors, never ending appointments, and varying diagnoses that continued to get worse as the year progressed. She has had chemotherapy, a mastectomy, and radiation.  After her mastectomy we learned her cancer in not curable only treatable. She has a very rare kind of cancer that will continue to come back. The only option for her to stay alive is to continue on her chemotherapy medication for the rest of her life.  This particular life saving medication is extremely expensive. She originally had to make a down payment of $6k just to start this medication back in July. The manufacturer Lilly has a program called LillyCares for financial assistance so she was approved to have her monthly copay of $2,500 a month waived. A couple days ago my mom was informed they will no longer cover her copay of $2,500 because she makes too much money. This copay is 3/4 of her monthly income and is a major financial hardship.  I am starting this fundraiser for $15k so she can afford her meds for the next 6 months while we try to figure out other options. We would greatly appreciate any donations to help us meet our goal. I know this would take a lot of stress off of her and would mean the world to our family. Thank you!♥️

Alexander's Drug Addiction Treatment Fund,"$5,143 raised of $10,000 goal","Hi friends and family,

I am humbly making this gofundme page for my brother Alexander. He has been suffering for years with mental illness and drug addiction caused by self medicating his mental issues. He has been homeless, on the streets, his health is in very poor shape, and he does not have health insurance. Drug addiction treatment centers are often extremely expensive without insurance. During these trying times of the COVID-19 pandemic, our family is unable to fund the detox and treatment he so desperately needs. We are resorting to this because we know how this can end if not treated urgently. We have tried the state-funded treatment center routes which are 1 very difficult to get into and 2 patients do not get the most effective treatment at most of those facilities. 

We need to lose the stigma of drug addiction as it is a disease and should be treated as such. My brothers illness has caused so much pain not only for him but for our family. Any little bit of help would be extremely appreciated.

Thank you,
The Osorio Family

Helping hands for Harley,"$15,179 CAD raised of $20,000 goal","My name is Jody and Harley is my soul dog. We have had 9 years together and everyday is a blessing. Harley has had many struggles over the last 2 years, two big surgeries after rupturing his knees 2 weeks apart. Surgery’s were 3 months apart. Both ACLs removed, full meniscus repairs and implants in both legs. 8 weeks ago Harley’s struggles got worse. He has been diagnosed with pancreatitis and it is a beast. I have done all the things, X-rays, full abdominal ultrasound several ER trips, continued daily visits or communications with his clinic. Harley needs very expensive medications and Veterinarian food. His meds costs are approximately $400 a month as is his food. I still am unsure if he is only dealing with pancreatitis and more tests are needed to rule out bowel disease or intestinal disease and rare forms of cancer. Harley needs help. He is on a medication called Cerenia and this is a $10 pill a day, he will need this for life, he gets monthly injections of Librela for his legs due to his surgeries. He seems to be needing the injection of Cerenia at least once a week as he struggles with just the oral pill. Goal to is to prevent him from another attack as each attack gets harder. This is not a reason to do end of life. The beginning of pancreatitis is challenging, it’s not a one size fits all. I am doing all of this on my own. If you are able to assist us during these troubled times, I would be grateful. Harley and I have spent 6 years working with Seniors and adults with disabilities and he is amazing. He has given his strength love to many. Including saving me at age one from a DV assault. I owe him my life. Harley is a 9 year old German Shepherd, balls are life as are walks, quiet time with mom and still visits with his beautiful work family. I will be uploading his vet bills and costs from his clinic next week as they put everything together. Ty for taking the time in reading this. Faith is everything to me and also Harley.

cover the cost of chemotherapy drug,"$5,225 raised of $15,000 goal","Hi, my name is Ardyth and I'm fundraising for Traci Webb
I know cancer is a hideous disease and a devastating diagnosis but I never knew how terribly expensive it is to treat. Traci was diagnosed with a rare form of lung cancer, 26 months ago. Up until now, with a lot of cutting back, wiping out savings, and amassing large credit card debt, she’s been able to keep up with the costs. Traci is a very private and proud person. It took a lot of persuading for her to agree to this GoFundMe account.
Traci is a single mother who raised a wonderful young man who is a junior in college. She has a good job but with the cost of living, education costs, and inflation it will be impossible to pay for this treatment without incurring a huge amount of debt. The co-pay for her new chemo drug is $4,860 per month and the trial period is 6 months. If it works as hoped it will become a maintenance drug.

Doctors say she has 4 months to live, but may be able to keep her alive for another year or so with their cancer study treatment plan. We are desperately trying a new drug that has saved her biological aunt, of 66 years of age, who also was diagnosed with terminal cancer (stage4)  8months ago - with 6months to live. However, this new drug, which is not supported by Medicaid yet, has cleared her aunt of almost all the cancer & she is now healthy & strong. We are hoping the drug has the same success to my beautiful wife of 12 years, who is only 34 years old. But, we need some help. She has been sick & in pain for a couple years now. Memorial Hospital Cancer center did a poor job & botched a couple surgeries also causing her pain, but refused to help her any further. She is now at University of Miami Sylvester Cancer Center which is addressing some of the mistakes made by the previous radiations & treatments.  She applied for government assistance, but she was denied. The lawyer explained that ""she will initially be denied then he could help with her claim"". However, she could be deceased by then. We could use some financial help to try to keep her alive & also help us take care of our 3 children, one who has special needs. $700 extra for this medication hits our household very hard. Anything helps.

Dahlia’s FIP Treatment,"$1,362 raised","Dahlia is only 18 months old and facing a life-threatening disease. On December 7th, she was diagnosed with the dry form of FIP, or Feline Infectious Peritonitis. FIP is fast-progressing and an invariably fatal disease. Dahlia was determined to already be in the late stages of the disease, due to off the chart bloodwork values, and non-regenerative anemia. She was given no more than a week to live.

There is no legal treatment or cure for FIP in the United States. However, there are two drugs legalized in the UK, Australia, and the Netherlands for use in felines with FIP, and the most effective drug has shown to be around 77% effective in treating FIP, excluding patients with ocular or neurological manifestations. The most effective drug is called GS-441524, a metabolite of Remdesivir, the drug used for treatment of severely ill COVID-19 human patients. The drug, however, is costly. Treatment of FIP consists of 84 days of daily injections, or starting with injections before switching to oral medication as the patient improves. Though, the oral medication is often more expensive than the injectable form.

Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a painful, incurable disease that, until recently, was nearly always fatal.

The problem: the company that created this drug refuses to license it for use in animals out of fear the it could interfere with the research for use in humans.

Please Help Kenai Fight FIP,$345 raised,"Kenai is a foster kitten of mine who has been diagnosed with wet FIP. For those who do not know, FIP(Feline infectious peritonitis) is a disease that affects less than 5% of cats, most commonly kittens under 2 years old. It is caused when the cat has a certain gene that mutates the feline coronavirus into deadly FIP. 

In wet FIP, this means the chest or abdomen fills with fluid, they become lethargic, develop a fever, lose their appetite, and essentially just wither away until they succumb to the disease. Some poor kitties even develop neurological issues. 

It has been long thought that FIP was not curable, but in recent years many cats (including two of my current cats) have completely recovered with no lasting health issues from the disease, with the help of the drug GS-441524. Dr. Niel Pedersen developed this treatment a few years back and has had nothing but success ever since. With 84 days of treatment followed by 84 days of observation, the cat is considered cured if no symptoms present! I have treated two foster kittens in the last year already and both are happy, healthy adult cats with no presenting issues now. If anyone has anymore questions on the treatment and how it works - feel free to reach out to me! 

Kenai deserves the same chance the other two kittens had, he deserves to live a full life. He has a brother named Koda (any brother bear fans out there?) that relies on him heavily and they are each others support systems. The goal is to get Kenai healthy and adopt the two brothers out together.

I just lost my precious 5-month old kitten to FIP last week and now Goose has FIP too. Most cats catch coronavirus at some point in their life and show few symptoms. A small percentage of cases mutate inside the individual's body into feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and the rate of mutation has been increasing causing more cats to be infected. As of right now, Goose will not eat and spends most of his time hiding. He has already lost 3 lbs. FIP has been fatal for decades but in the past few years, a successful treatment has been developed. Unfortunately, this treatment is extremely expensive. The vials of the drug alone cost will cost $1200 at the very least. The price is expected to increase as he gains weight back. I will also have to take him in for bloodwork on days 30, 60, & 80 of treatment and there are several prescriptions he will need as well. I will need to purchase all of the supplies myself such as needles, syringes, supplements, etc. There are very few foods that he will eat given his near-nonexistent appetite caused by the FIP and these foods are costly. I usually only buy these as treats due to the price. It all adds up quickly and is definitely out of my price range, but I won't give up. I appreciate any donations immensely.","Raised $1,435 from 29 donations"

The doctors have expressed that there are generally three antibiotics that they can give to try and clear the infection, all of which are very expensive. The first drug they gave her can be very toxic and started to cause extreme damage to her kidneys so she had to stop taking it. She was given the second one until yesterday, at which point it became clear that it wasn’t working and then they switched her to that third and final drug. They are wanting to do an MRI to see if the infection has spread to her tissue or her bones but they are unable to because the contrast can be damaging to her kidneys and because of the kidney infection and the damage from the first antibiotic they’re unable to give her that at this time.

Hope for Sarah,"$2,635 raised of $15,000 goal","Sarah Lewis was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive cancer in late September of 2022. It started oddly enough, as an achy shoulder. A team of doctors and specialists jumped on it quite quickly and are doing a great job of treating her. Expenses are mounting quickly, and we, her co-workers, friends, and family would like to help as much as possible. While we can’t take away the cancer or the ever-increasing pain, we can help relieve some of the financial burden so there is one less thing for her to worry about and she can concentrate on getting well. She still came in to work with a smile and a thumbs up while going through chemo and radiation treatments. These treatments did their job and slowed the progression. Her doctors prescribed a cancer drug that can replace the chemo and radiation, but the drug is very expensive, and her insurance doesn’t cover all the costs. Right now, she is facing 15-18K in unpaid medical expenses. The new drug is working, and she is on the long road to winning the battle. She recently found out that the drug is working so well she will not require a surgery that had been planned for February 2023. She became engaged just before receiving the cancer diagnosis and is planning on getting married this May. A bright spot in an otherwise dark time. We know she has the fight of her life ahead of her and we would all like to thank anyone and everyone who can help us help a wonderful friend, sister, aunt, and daughter. Thank you.

With much heartache, my family was notified my 37-year-old brother was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in November 2022, better known as ALS. Nothing can prepare you for the agonizing news. As a family, we are keeping hope for a cure while he fights this disease. This is no news anyone ever wants to hear. I imagined being able to celebrate my brother's 50th birthday and his and Melysa's 30th wedding anniversary. He is an amazing father to 2 boys ages 6 & 9, I thought he'd get to watch them get married and have children but instead, they are going to see their father struggle as this disease progresses. But we’re praying we have many more years with him. Ross is currently seeking other options as far as clinical trials and medications. As you can imagine the cost of these things is going to keep climbing. He is no longer able to work and my beautiful sis n law is continuing to work and do what she can but we do realize in the future her work will become solely focused on the caretaking of her husband. We do not know when but this disease progresses at its own quick pace, the timeline of ALS is 3-5 years. My goal is to assist them with making my brother's comfort a number one priority. Assisting with new bills and medical equipment he will need down the road. Most importantly though, give him the ability to Fight and fight HARD! If you know my brother you know he's selfless, he's loyal, he's loving and he never asks for anything. I know one thing he would ask for is to love his family, keep peace and cherish every day. Every dollar, Every share, and Every comment of positivity means so much. Let's all come together for Ross, his wife and his two Boys; Ross and Matthew.

Help Jackson receive life saving treatment.,"$2,026 raised of $2,500 goal","Hi, my name is Rachel and I started foster caring for Jackson, a 5 month old Tuxedo kitten, last week. He has been very ill and has symptoms such as excessive hunger, bloated belly, and very bad diarrhea. I took him to the vet for blood work and the levels were all over the place, he tested positive for 2 strains of Feline Coronavirus, and I was told he has Wet FIP. A death sentence up until 2019, FIP is now curable thanks to Dr Neils Pederson and his team discovering that the experimental anti-viral drug GS-441524 has cured cats with FIP in trials conducted at UC Davis. I have purchased the 1st 2 bottles of this expensive medication but I need help purchasing the other 12+ bottles required to complete Jackson's 84 day treatment. I'm asking any kind, compassionate people out there to please donate to help Jackson get this potentially life saving medication. He is a very sweet, friendly kitten who is just starting out in life and I want to give him the opportunity to beat this terrible illness. Even though he has been very ill he still has so much life left in him! Any amount that you can contribute would be a tremendous blessing to Jackson and I. Thank you in advance for your generosity, kindness, and love of animals including beautiful little Jackson. I will certainly give updates on his progress along the way. Thank you so very much!!!

Help 9 month old Rehansh get a ray of life !,"$1,742 CAD raised","World's Costliest Drug Zolgensma Is Rehansh's Only Hope!

Imagine if you woke up in the middle of the night. You wish to move but you can’t, no matter how much you try. Sounds scary right? Sadly this is the condition of 9-month-old Rehansh from Indiia who has Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1. The day he was diagnosed, a price was stamped on the child’s life.



What is Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1 (SMA)?

It is a genetic disease affecting the entire nervous system, peripheral nervous system, and hence voluntary muscle movement. Maximum nerve cells that control muscles are located in the spinal cord, which accounts for the word spinal in the name of the disease. 


SMA affects 1 in 10,000 babies and is the #1 genetic cause of infant death worldwide.


“My name is Rudrakshi Monga, I and my husband Manish Suri are seeking your help for our son Rehansh. On 2nd May 2020, Manish and I were blessed with our baby boy. It was during the peak time of COVID-19 while trying to protect our bundle of joy from that deadly virus we did not see something a lot worse sneak up on our happiness.

Everything was going well up till the fourth month. We couldn’t be happier for our new member but then things started going downhill. Suddenly he was unable to lift his legs. After consulting a doctor we were informed that it would improve with time. However, it wasn’t until he turned six months that we started to suspect something larger at play as he wasn’t able to even hold his own weight and sit up on his own. When consulted, we were informed to put him under Occupational Therapy but to no avail. Desperate to find an answer we underwent Genetic Counselling. The reports of those crumbled our world. He was suffering from SMA Type 1. We were also told that the only hope for Rehansh to have a normal life is to be able to import Zolgensma, a one-time gene replacement therapy, which in his current state could be a potential cure. This medicine also happens to be the most expensive drug in the world - USD 2.1 Million / CAD 2.65 Million / INR 160 Million” 




Our Motive is to give him a Fulfilling and Long Lifespan, but the cost of which is something we cannot bear. So does that mean we will lose our child?


WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP

Donate money: Please donate whatever you can spare. Every donation will count towards saving Rehansh and giving him a chance at living a good and fulfilling life. Alone the parents cannot bear to save little Rehash but together it is not impossible. The times are hard for everyone. Even sharing this story on social media will play an important role.

Contribute your time. We are in for the long haul in our fight against this deadly disease. The best course of action is to raise awareness and get the necessary infrastructure set up in India. Only time and continuous lobbying will contribute to long-lasting change.
Spread the word. Healthy parents could have a genetically affected baby. Genetic testing is in a nascent state in India, with limited labs and clinics available for diagnosis. Tell others about genetic testing, so this becomes a common practice as it is in most western countries like the USA and Canada, where genetic screening is part of post-natal care.



One of the best feelings in the world is Saving a Life. Your donation will not only help our son live his life but will help us preserve our Family.

For Folks from India, you can also donate directly to the recepient's account-

Demi needs your help scoring drugs (for FIP),"$1,045 raised of $1,800 goal","Greetings hoomans,

I am the kitten Demeter (Demi) and I have asked my strange hooman caretaker to write this important message. You see, I have been feeling pretty icky lately. I am only 3 months old, but for half my life, I have been unable to play with my mommy and sisters due to this yucky feeling. The strange lady writing this message has been trying to figure out what has been making me sleepy and sick. Then last week, my tummy began to grow bigger, and bigger, and bigger! The strange lady saw this and immediately contacted her super hero friends at NAWS Humane Society in Mokena, IL.

Help save Kristina's life,"$16,876 raised","Kristina Golovchanskaya from Voronezh, Russia is seventeen months old and has been diagnosed with a disease called Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 1. 




The life expectancy of kids with SMA Type 1 without treatment is usually 2 years. To survive, Kristina needs to a one-time injection of a drug called Zolgensma, which is made by the pharmaceutical giant Novartis. For the drug to work, she needs to take it before turning two in January of 2021, assuming she can survive that long. Right now, the only way she can get this drug is to pay for it. At $2.1 million, it's the world's most expensive drug. Like others, we've repeatedly pleaded with the drug's manufacturer, but they have not helped.



Because SMA Type 1 is aggressive and degenerative, we're in a race against time. With each day that passes, the motor neurons in Kristina's body are becoming inactive.



- Please share Kristina's GoFundMe link on your social media accounts to encourage others to support

Help Linda Get Treatment for Glioblastoma,"$11,425 raised of $10,000 goal","Update February 7, 2024
By God’s grace Mom has been successfully fighting GBM for over a year. However, her last MRI showed slight growth of her tumor. Because of this growth her doctor recommended changing her to the chemotherapy drug Lomustine. Unfortunately over the past several years this drug has become incredibly expensive due to the manufacturer increasing the price per pill. The current dosage Mom will be taking is going to cost over $1,000 per dose, and could increase if her dosage changes. She will have a minimum of six doses over the next 8 months. Insurance covers very little of this cost, so we are seeking any assistance we can to cover this expense. Along with the additional expenses of traveling to Duke every six weeks now instead of every eight weeks.

Fund My Sister's Addiction Recovery,"$2,790 raised of $2,500 goal","This gofundme is to raise money to help my sister, Lauren Dixon, finally beat her drug addiction. We will use it to pay for her rehab and give her starting money to get her in a live-in home away from Fishers where she is drug tested daily and will be held accountable. Places like these are expensive and my family doesn't have the money to pay the first month of rent and other expenses up front. I'll explain more about what we will do with this money later.
Around age 15 my sister Lauren started drinking and using drugs. Peer pressure and other factors kept her drinking and using. Then, in 2010, my mom was diagnosed with lung cancer. This was extremely hard on the family.
My sister kept using drugs throughout this, and eventually dropped out of high school. My parents had her in and out of rehab and each time Lauren would come back home and meet up with her friends who would offer her drugs and alcohol. Being around these people, as well as the nature of addiction, has kept her on drugs. 
In 2013 our mom died unexpectedly. Everyone in the family was heartbroken. Lauren kept using. Later that year my sister finally got out of Fishers. She moved to Florida and met her boyfriend, eventually moving in with him. She stayed off of drugs and finally got a healthier lifestyle. This was the happiest I'd seen her since we were kids. 
The next year when she and her boyfriend broke up, she moved back home. I thought that everything would be different now, and she did too. Eventually she started using again. Alcohol, narcotics, opiates. Anything she could get ahold of. Since the summer of 2014 she has been in and out of rehab three times. And every time she comes out, she gives in and uses drugs sooner than the last time. 
Since our mom died she has battled depression. She has no high school diploma. She can hardly hold a job since her life has been so unstable lately. Since she moved back to Fishers, virtually all of the money she has earned has gone to either drugs or to her friend, who lent her money to buy a car. She wants to get her GED and move away, but with an addiction problem and no money, it has always seemed impossible. 

All of this culminated into a terrible car accident in early July. My sister blacked out and swerved into the other lane of traffic, hitting a truck head on. She was driving to go buy heroin. She wanted to mix Xanax and heroin, killing herself. I'm glad she got into the car crash, because if she hadn't, she would have killed herself.  She was taken to the hospital and was extremely lucky. She had a few stitches in her mouth and was a little cut up, but the rest of her is fine. Her car was totaled in the accident. After her release from the hopsital, I drove her to drug rehab, where she has been since. This time, more than any other time, she is serious. She is serious about changing her life, getting away from Fishers, turning her life around. She knows that she should have died that Thursday, and the only thing that stopped her was the car accident.
We are trying to raise money to pay for the first few weeks of a live-in program where Lauren will live with three other girls who are also battling addiction. They attend programs from 9-4 every day, going to AA, NA, and other meetings frequently. With the rest of their time, they can get jobs. Our plan is to use the money we raise here to pay the initial cost of living at this housing. Lauren will continue to recover for the first week or so, going to extensive recovery classes, and then get a job so she can continue to pay rent and other fees and continue living there. Every time she has gotten out of rehab she has relapsed. And every time she relapses she has gotten closer and closer to overdosing. I am afraid that if she comes home again, it will be the end. She simply can not come home again and be with her friends and her connections who she buys from. I'm looking to raise $1000 to help her recover from her addiction once and for all and to finally get her life back on track. Any donation will help. If you don't have anything to donate, please share this story. Thanks for reading.

Keep Simon Smiling,"$10,138 CAD raised of $9,000 goal","Simon Troy Beler was born on July 31, 2011. He was born with a heart defect called double outlet right ventricle. He was delivered three weeks early due to maternal hypertension.  He was kept in the NICU. At the tender age of three weeks Simon suffered a stroke. He required three surgeries to repair his heart. The first one was a shunt at 8 days old. The second one, the Glenn surgery was done at 7 months old. His most recent one, the Fontan surgery was done in August of 2014. He is currently dealing with possible complications called Plastic bronchitis and PLE. Right now he is in hospital in Saskatoon receiving super expensive medications via nebulizer. He won't be able to go home until he's approved for exceptional drug status so he can have these meds at home. 
Simon has come a long way and stolen the hearts of many with that courageous warm and winning smile. He is currently requiring more care than he has for quite a while. He requires one of his parents to be at home with him not just through this illness, but each illness because he's too fragile to stay with just anyone. Few parents are set up well enough to be able to take blocks of time off without pay. Mom's family leave has been used up already so the days she is spending with Simon are unpaid. In addition, there are expenses being incurred with each trip to the specialist and Simon would also benefit from a child's oximeter. 
My goal is to raise $2500 or more to put into an investment account. That way, they can use what they need immediately and the rest can earn money hopefully, for any future expenses.

Veronica's Medical Expenses,"$5,250 raised of $7,000 goal","Hello Dear Friends,

We had actually hoped to avoid doing this, but with so many people asking how they can help Veronica and where they can donate, we thought it would be best to set up this account.  
As many of you know, Veronica was suddenly struck with a life threatening auto immune disease called Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (AHUS) in early July.  She spent 22 days in the hospital enduring several rounds of dialysis and plasmaphoresus treatments.  She has fought like a champion and was released from the hospital, but unfortunately will need to take an extremly expensive mediation for the rest of her life.  The drug is called Soliris, and cost over $500,000 per year.  This drug is literally the only thing available in modern medicine that can keep her alive. Luckily we have good insurance, but our max out of pocket expenses were met within the month, and we are looking at medical bills in the amount of $7000.  We have no idea when Veronica will be able to return to work and our finances are running short.  If you know Veronica at all, you know there is nothing she wouldn't do to help another person in need,  and as hard as it is to admit and ask, we are the ones who need your help this time.
If anyone is willing and able to donate towards our medical expenses, we would be eternally grateful.

Thank you in advance,

Mark's Liver Transplant Fund,"$2,965 raised of $5,000 goal","My husband, Mark Miller was diagnosed with end stage liver disease last year.  He is now on the transplant list. As you can imagine this has been a very stressful time for our family. It has also been very difficult trying to keep up with all the medical expenses from the specialists co-pays, medication expenses and my taking off work to travel 2 1/2 hours one way to visit the Hepatologist in the area. With that being said, we have several required hoops to jump thru before the transplant can take place. One of which, we have to set up a fund with a minimum of $2,500 for post-surgery expenses. This is required because of extremely expensive medications required afterwards. For example: his co-pay for the anti-rejection drug (Valcyte) is $1,130 for a 30 day supply.  He will need this medication for 3-6 months. This doesn't include the other 2 meds that he will take rest of his life at $100 each per month or the time that I will have to take off work initially to care for him. 
Please keep Mark and our family in your thoughts and prayers.  We sincerely appreciate your support.","Conyers, GA"

Lifesaving FIP Treatment for Benjamin,"$3,825 raised of $4,000 goal","Benjamin needs your help!! Benjamin was adopted in May, but sadly and suddenly was diagnosed with FIP. He's only 4 months old :(

FIP is a mutation of the feline coronavirus. The disease progresses very rapidly (in a matter of days), and in the past has almost always been fatal. However, treatment is now available!! There's an experimental drug that's been used in the past few years to treat FIP, and it's quite literally saved the lives of 1000's and 1000's of kittens and cats all over the world.

There is a Veterinarian in our area (in northern VA) who has been treating FIP for a while now with a great success rate. Benjamin was able to get an emergency consult with her, and while he's a very sick little guy, they have hope that he'll recover with the drug treatment. He was started on it immediately after getting diagnosed, and his prognosis is guarded, but optimistic.

Please help save Echo!,"$1,860 raised of $3,000 goal","Hey friends, my name is Bonnie Kazanjian and I am Rich Kazanjian's sister in law. I started this page in hopes of helping raise funds for Rich's kitten, Echo. Those of you who know Rich, know that his animals are his world! He would do anything for his precious fur babies. Unfortunately Rich is currently deployed overseas and Echo is living us during this time. Echo is a 6 month old, PRECIOUS kitten who Rich rescued this summer prior to his deployment. Echo started to get sick about a month ago. He suddenly became lethargic, decreased appetite, and started drooling. We rushed him to the vet, ran a bunch of tests and found out that he had Feline Coronavirus. (Yes, cats can get COVID too). We thought that he was out of the woods until about a week ago when he suddenly started to deteriorate again. He has been loosing weight despite eating, he sleeps constantly, and he has zero energy. We brought him back to the vet this week where he was admitted for IV fluids and antibiotics as well as a slew of tests, viral panels, stool samples, urine samples, X-rays, and an ultrasound. The tests were ALL inconclusive. The vets are completely stumped as to why this kitten can barely hold his head up. Their only conclusion at this time is that he has FIP (Feline Infectious Peritonitis) which is disease that has a 99% fatality rate within weeks. There isn't a test for FIP, but it is a variant of FCoV (feline coronavirus) which he tested positive for. FIP is diagnosed after all other viruses have been ruled out, which is now the case with Echo. We are still waiting for 1 more viral panel result to come back, which we should know by the end of this week, but until then we were told to assume he has FIP.

Love and Life for Lancelot - FIP Fighter!,"$1,739 raised of $5,000 goal","I rescued Lancelot November 2019 and in July 2020 he was diagnosed with the wet form of FIP as well as neuro/ocular.  The medicine is very expensive and the normal length of treatment is usually 84 days but today is day 140 due to relapses and development of drug resistance.  Because of Lancelot becoming increasingly drug resistance the dosages had to be doubled and then tripled in order to battle the virus.

In the beginning I thought I'd be able to pay for his treatments on my own.  I am a senior citizen living on a fixed income and have spent most of my savings for Lancelot.  As the dosages increased and the length of time he is on the medication gets longer I realize I have to swallow my pride and ask for help.

As of today I've already invested $15,000 to save Lancelot's life.  Now, in order to overcome his drug resistance, he is on 24 pills a day at $8 a pill.  That is $192 each day. 

With the kindness of strangers, Lancelot has a chance of beating this nasty virus and living a much longer and healthy life.  Your generosity will forever be appreciated.  Thank you!

Help Johnny get medicine,"$2,135 raised of $2,800 goal","Hi, I'm Adele. I'm raising money for Johnny, my 8-month-old teenage cat.

Johnny was diagnosed with Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP). It’s a 100% fatal disease if not treated. 

Faced with a big learning curve, it was either jump in or put him down; he wouldn’t likely live more than a few days. He’d been an enthusiastic eight-month-old the week before. He’s one-third of our lively cat family, ready for the best year of his life and one happy guy- so we jumped in.

Although experimental, there’s hope. An anti-viral drug has been in development and testing since 2019, “in my back yard” at UCD Vet Hospital, I’ve learned. It's a 3-month regimen.

His response to treatment has been phenomenal. He felt better after the first treatment. We’re now three weeks in and have nine weeks to go. There’s an 82-90% projection for a full recovery. 

Some of you had asked how you could help.  I set up this Go Fund Me page to help Johnny Electrolux (the “electric” cat) and us afford good care.  Any support is greatly appreciated. The medicine is expensive, about $30/day. Additional blood tests are, too, and these are very lean times. 

We've been using medicine from and are participating in the CUREFIP donation program. Every dollar donated and spent on medicine will be match by them.  For example: I will buy two weeks of medicine but they will send 4 weeks of medicine. This is amazing.

It hasn’t been easy. I’ll spare the nitty-gritty details but am willing to chat if you seek information. At this time, there’s no preventative vaccine. The medicine is not covered by insurance and cannot be prescribed by a veterinarian. 1-2% of cats have this and die horrible deaths. It’s like the flu; some recover with little effort, and some don’t. It’s an individual's specific reaction to a common virus. Johnny didn’t have the antibodies to eliminate the virus. He was diagnosed as suffering from dry FIP, with ocular and possibly neurological complications.

Please help. With this medicine, there’s a great chance Johnny can develop antibodies to win this for the rest of his spunky life.

As of now, Mustika has not received any assistance for the upper and lower jaw surgery. I came to visit Mustika in the clinic and she seems very happy to see me visit and has the will to live. I spoke with the doctor who is treating Mustika and he said the fees for the surgery are very expensive because the drug given is more expensive than usual. I took him to the good vet but to be honest I won't know the final medical expenses until he is completely healed. Please help with donating or sharing to help Mustika medical care/expenses so he can have a full recovery. Thank you for your help

Help my husband fight pancreatic cancer,"$1,645 raised of $5,000 goal","Hi, I'm Diane and the pictures are of my husband Ron. In June our lives were turned upside down by his diagnosis with pancreatic cancer. He was in and out of the hospital for months before a diagnosis was finally made, which has drained us emotionally and financially. His medication is thousands a month and medicare only covers part. He's been through so much and the financial hole we're in has only made a horrible situation even worse. We were living a good life after 30 years of marriage and hoping to spend the rest of it together, making plans and now we've had to change everything. One of the chemo drugs makes him so sensitive to cold that he can no longer even have a cold drink and even breathing cold air could cause his throat to close, paralyze, causing him to lose his breath for up to 20 seconds. We must keep the house warm causing our heating bills to go through the roof. Seeing this happen to such an active, loving partner has been heartbreaking. He's lost about 40 pounds and his diet has to include a lot of ensure to keep his calories and protein up which is also expensive. His has little appetite so it's important that what he eats is nutritious with lots of protein. This has of course caused our grocery bills to increase during a time when grocery bills are increasing even for a normal family. He is going through so much pain that often he keeps us both up at night and the medications he has to take is also expensive. He's also developed septicemia from having a biliary bag, which was draining bile from his liver, in so long before his diagnosis. The antibiotic he had to have has a co-pay of 400 dollars and he had to have it done twice. We are struggling to keep him alive and with good treatment even pancreatic cancer can have a survival r ate of at least 5 years. Unfortunately the whipple which is the only surgical cure for pancreatic cancer wasn't an option for him. So every other week he has chemo, carries a bag home with him that delivers more chemo over two days, then wears a patch that delivers a drug to increase his white blood cells. All these have to be watched for leaks as the chemo is very caustic. The chemo takes everything out of him and he spends the week off recuperating the chemo week. He's hoping to lessen the chemo and start on radiation soon which means a daily trip to the hospital for the treatments. We're afraid of all the loss of income will cause us to lose our car as we're behind on so many bills because of the expenses related to this cruel illness. We're not used to begging for help but this is a situation beyond our control and when you're fighting to stay alive the last thing you want to worry about is if you're going to have a car to take you to treatment next time. Or if we can pay the heating bill to keep him from feeling the awful effects from the chemo drugs. This is a last ditch effort to help us survive this without losing everything and hopefully keep my husband, my best friend alive as long as possible. I thank anyone who is able to help.

Help Robyn fight her battle,"$5,900 AUD raised of $100,000 goal","Robyn is 57, a mother of 3, Jade, Brooke & Joel. She is a new Grandmother to her 3 week old Grandaughter Jordyn & has a Grandson on the way.

Five years ago doctors discovered Robyn had a lung growth which turned out to be Non small cell lung cancer. Surgeons removed the right lower lobe of her lung which contained a grade 2A lung cancer. No chemotherapy or radiation was given as they believed they had totally removed the problem.

Robyn was monitored by oncologists for the next 2 1/2 years.

After 2 1/2 years oncologists discovered a new growth in the right middle lobe of her lung. She was operated on again & a section of the lung was removed containing the cancer growth. Before Robyn had made it out of hospital, doctors discovered cancer activity in the left lung, which classified Robyn with Stage 4 Lung Cancer.

Robyn was then placed on a targeted oral chemotherapy drug called Tarceva.

Recently (March 2017) the oral therapy drug stopped working and Robyn unfortunatly became very ill, where she spent more time in the Austin's Olivia Newton John Cancer wellness & research centre. Cancer was also discovered in her abdominal region at this time. Fortunatly she has slowly recovered.

Robyn is now on a new oral chemotherapy drug called Targrisso. This is the last of the targeted  therapy drugs that are available for treatment of Robyn's condition at this time.

Presently we are about to include in the medical treatments for Robyn, techniques of intergrative medicine. This new protocol will be done through the National Institute of Intergrative Medicine (NIIM) which is situated in Hawthorn, Victoria, Australia.

The new treatments will include ;
- Whole body & local hyperthermia (heating of the body)
- Intravenious nutrients administered including Vitamin C
- Ketogenic dietary advice
- Hyperbaric oxygen therapy

The advice & treatment from the National Institute of Intergrative Medicine is very expensive & this is why Robyn needs financial support to fund these life extending treatments.

These new treatments have had very good success with Robyn's condition in other parts of the world, where they are presently being used.

Oncologists are finding that many late stage cancer patients are benefitting greatly with combined Medical & Metabolic (Intergrative) treatments.

Zakariya's Fight For Life- SMA Type 1,"£78,880 raised","Imagine you were told that your little baby boy may not see his 2nd birthday and the only way that he would is through the World’s most expensive drug.

Well, just over 2 weeks ago our miracle baby Zakariya received this heart-breaking news - He was diagnosed with the extremely rare Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA Type 1).
SMA affects the central nervous system and voluntary skeletal muscle movement. Consequently, affecting many basic motor functions, some of which are walking, leg/hand movements and feeding.
After progression, SMA sufferers lose the ability to swallow, breathe and can go on to eventually die. 


My name is Zakariya, (Zaki for short) I was born on the 11th of October 2020 and -
My mummy and daddy’s tough journey started 5 years ago when they were told that they could not conceive, many tests, and failed rounds of IVF later they decided to leave it to fate. Amazingly one year later I made a surprise natural appearance.

The 18th of May 2021 changed my life forever. At only 7 months old, I received the that I have the extremely rare, degenerative, and life-threatening disease SMA Type 1 which Regardless of my diagnosis, I consider myself incredibly lucky because This gives my mummy and daddy a lot of hope for a happier future for the three of us.



The NHS automatically funds this life-changing treatment for up to 6-months-old. Unfortunately, I narrowly missed out on this opportunity as I was 7 months and 1 week old when diagnosed.

This awful disease, however, the treatment of Zolgensma has made it possible for children just like me to live past their 2nd  birthday. I know that life will always be different for me and I have a long road ahead -

the stronger I will become and the least time my life will be in danger.  and follow me on my journey to live a long and happy life.

When you look at me, I look ""normal"", I even smile, laugh, and sometimes cry but my body has and could at any point continue to give up on me. and could be cut short at any point with something as simple as a cold or a flu.

If 200,000 angels LIKE YOU can donate £10 each, I will have a second chance at life. I understand that £10 is a lot of money but every penny counts, even if it is £1 or a share to your friends and family I will be eternally grateful.


Zakariya is our little miracle and always will be. We are a strong and positive family. We ask for your help in for this incredible lifesaving drug and aftercare, which will give our baby boy a

When given the news that we would never have children, we made the decision to let go of our ultimate dream of having a family. We decided to go travelling and Dubai was the destination, far away from our struggles.  Little did we know a miracle was on its way to us, 2 months in we found out we were naturally pregnant. Zakariya made his appearance in October and we decided to return to the UK.

Zakariya has missed all his milestones, he has never rolled over, sat unassisted, he has a little strength in his head, but it is very tiring for him to hold for long, he has completely lost the ability to lift or move his legs (only his feet move) and his arms are considerably weaker.

Zolgensma has been extremely successful and can show significant changes within a couple of days to weeks. With time, some children have gone on to take their first steps.
It is a difficult thing to read but as first-time parents and having the gift of life given to us and the possibility of it being taken away, and if that means we must do everything in our power to get this incredible treatment for him,

When we reach our target, we will have several hospitals to choose from either within the UK or in the US (Boston Children’s hospital) - The current US quote stands between $2.2 - $2.9 million which does not include travel expenses, accommodation and aftercare costs.







Let us stand together and give this the best gift of all… - Something which we all take for granted every day. From the bottom of our hearts, we thank for what you can - It goes beyond words the gratitude and appreciation we have for you all is unfathomable.   



Lots of love from Baby Zakariya, Tara & Mo.

Save Abigael's Kidneys,"$4,300 CAD raised of $4,200 goal","UPDATE I just spoke with the doctors and we have great news! Abigaels protein levels in her urine are the lowest that we have seen in months (900 vs 3000) but ultimately that number should be 0. Abigael will be in the hospital for a few more days as they monitor her low magnesium levels. If those stabalize, she could be home this weekend. This being said, we have not heard back from any compassion societies on an answer but they have put a rush on the paperwork so please pray for favour! As it stands, thanks to the generous love and support, we have enough for her first 'outpatient' vial!!! There are no words at the blessing that is! The pharmacy will be giving me an exact price on that vial tomorrow. In short, Abigael is in REMISSION!!!!!! YESSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!! This makes the next two doses of this medicine even more important. I am hoping and praying that the between the love and support of everyone through GoFundMe and the compassion society, that we can raise enough for her 4th and final vial and that her kidneys would be completely restored!!! Thankyou again, and please keep sharing this campaign This is Abigael Lily, and she needs your help. Abigael was born a beautiful, 7 pound, healthy baby girl in Novemeber 2015. At 2 years of age (January 2018) she contracted pneumonia. She beat it, only to begin to swell like a balloon and contract pneumonia again in February. In March she was diagnosed with Nephrotic syndrome, a rare auto-immune disease in which the filters of her kidneys were compromised. She was started on steroids among other medicines and from March to May she received 9 blood product transfusions. Finally, she underwent a kidney biopsy in June. One week later, Sunday June 24th, we brought her in, due to the absolute exhaustion she was showing. Overnight, she went into kidney failure and her renal system (tubes in kidneys) colapsed due to a lack of blood flow and therefore her ability to urinate became impossible. The biopsy results show an even more rare form of the syndrome, known as fsgs. She has been in the hospital ever since. After a long struggle, many treatments of dialysis, and a lot of patience, her vitals are stable, and her urinating has started to improve. Now we have an opportunity, a 70 percent chance of having her kidneys recover with a certain medicine, and with that, my baby girl can have the tube to her heart removed, and become a kid again!! However, she cannot have this medicine until her kidneys have stabilized. And she is still in kidney failure. The problem: To get her kidneys to the level they need to be, she needs 4 viles over the next 4 weeks of a very expensive drug. The viles are 3500 plus tax a piece, and she will need all 4 for the best chance at saving her kidneys. The hospital will cover the first two and we are in application for assistance from some compassion agencies but time is very short. To put it simply, we need just under $8000.00 ... by the 1st of August. The doctors made it clear. If we dont want her to live a life of dialysis, transplants, and hospitalization, if we want to save her kidneys, and in turn her childhood, then we must act now. She received her first vile today, and they are monitoring her very closely. Please share the crap out of this, help me give my baby her childhood back. Together, we can save her kidneys. Thankyou to everyone, wether donating, sharing on socials, or sending prayers and thoughts of love and life! We couldn't have made it this far without you, now it's time to end this.

Kevin Bammel's Sarcoma Fund,"$1,940 raised of $5,000 goal","Life is like a velvety red-petaled rose that demonstrates we are blessed in many ways. One of my blessings has been the life of my son, Kevin. He has such a kind and giving spirit that brings a special blessing to all that know him. He often puts others’ feelings and needs above his own. But, even in the midst of beauty, we often face thorns of life. One massive thorn in Kevin’s life has been the diagnosis of Ewing’s small cell sarcoma a year ago in September. It has been a rough road, yet Kevin’s spirit remained positive, and he brought a smile to everyone around him.. Because of the nature of the disease, the chemo treatment was extremely intense. Kevin endured six rounds. After finishing chemo, he completed 25 treatments of radiation last Spring. The doctors gave him a brief respite before thoracic surgery to remove the tumor, part of his rib cage, and a small section of his right lung where the tumor had adhered. We all were optimistic after surgery and hopeful that no further treatments would be needed. The doctors determined Kevin would need at least eight, if not more, rounds of chemo. The blessing in this new series of rounds was that after two rounds, one of the drugs could be taken orally which would, hopefully, allow Kevin to return to work which it has. This has been another blessing in the road to recovery. But, again with every blessing, another thorn appears. The cost of the drug is extremely expensive. He takes the pills for five days, two pills per day each round. The cost for the pills alone is $1500-$1600 for each round. As Kevin has returned to work, in spite of days where he feels sick and exhausted, he earns enough to make payments to the hospital (a required amount) and pay for some medications. When he doesn’t have the funding, he can’t get his medicines/drugs as prescribed for his treatments. Then, one has to consider living expenses as well. The diagnosis of cancer so encompasses one’s life, that the realization of everyday living doesn’t hit until one is in the midst of the struggle. There are few people in our world today who have not been affected by cancer in some way. Those who have realize the enormity of the expenses involved for treatment and the struggle to pay bills. I know each individual has their own struggles, but I would humbly ask that if you feel led to give a little something to Kevin to help in this struggle so his rose can continue to demonstrate beauty in our world, we would be forever grateful.

Help Heal Canton; Hemp & Local Art,"$4,080 raised of $15,000 goal","My dream is to help our society solve the problems it faces. These problems include drug addiction, expensive medical treatment, over prescription of pain medication,  government corruption, unemployment, and education. I believe that through hemp and supporting local artists I can help many of those issues. My vision is to open a business that features art from local artists such as glass blowing, lamp working, sewing, crocheting, wire wrapping, drawing, painting, baking, dyeing, soap making, music, or any talent or skill. By supporting their craft over imports from other cities, states, or countries, this keeps the money in our community so it can be used to create better improvements. This also provides work for skilled craftsmen and women as well as beautiful art to brighten lives. This gives the opportunity for unique, custom artwork. All the while, you can feel good knowing a hardworking individual can eat or pay rent because of you.

The other aspect of this business will be focused on hemp and marijuana education. It will be a center for activism and for the community to come to with questions or concerns. I will also stock all available legal hemp-derived CBD products. This would help our areas heroin and opiate epidemic as it would reduce the amount of pain people are in therefore resulting in less prescriptions and better quality of life. Many people eho resort to heroin start with opiates. CBD is just as effective at pain relief, treating inflammation, muscle spasticity, and much more and is all natural with no negative side effects.

Hemp is also an excellent crop to help support cleansing our environment through air and soil purification. Hemp is great at absorbing carbon dioxide and aerating soil. Hemp is also a good example of how our government will often pass laws that later can be proven unreasonable. I will use this as an opportunity to support the marijuana legalization movement in Ohio. 

This is my dream. I would love if you could help make this a reality! Thank you!!

Emma needs help to maximize her potential,"£390 raised of £10,000 goal","Hi, my name is Julie and I am fundraising for my granddaughter who has type 2 Spinal Muscular Atrophy.
The NHS does not offer Zolgensma which is a gene therapy with fantastic life changing results to type 2 sufferers because of it's enormous price tag. It is the world's most expensive drug but just one infusion can be the difference between walking or not.
At the moment this medication is only offered to type 1 sufferers because in their case it can mean the chance of living beyond 2 years, therefore such children are given priority.
I have therefore decided to try to raise the required funds to give this wonderful child a shot at a more normal life.

Please Help to Save Misha - Time is Running Out!,"$2,000,002 raised","https://www.instagram.com/mishkawinsma/ 
(* $8.8k  raised on GoFundMe out of $500k international goal*
*Altogether raised $1,107 k of 2.3 million*)

Hello EVERYONE. We are Misha Bakhtins’ parents Iana (Yana) Gafinetc and Dmitrii Bakhtin from Ekaterinburg. Misha (Mikhail Bakhtin) was born with devastating genetic condition SMA Type 1 (Spinal Muscular Atrophy). SMA is a disease that steals from babies the ability to talk, eat, sit up and even breathe.

We launched this GoFundMe page in a desperate attempt to save Misha’s life and give him a chance for a healthy and happy future. We URGENTLY need your help in raising $ 2.3 million for the priciest drug in the world, Zolgensma. Without this one-time dose genetic treatment, there is no hope for Misha … Please be of these people who Misha’s life by giving. 

 

We know that $2.3 million sounds unreal, but we are less than one month into our fundraising campaign, and we raised more than $500,000! And the donations from incredibly kind people like all of you continue to flow in.



We were so thrilled to find out that Iana (Yana) was pregnant and so excited to hear at 12 weeks screening that we were expecting a baby boy. Pregnancy was easy without any problems.

Misha was born on July 22, 2020 with no complications. We were so happy to bring him home and start a new page of our life. For the first two weeks, Misha did not show any signs of this devastating condition. He was eating and sleeping normally. We were so happy! We could not even image that our long-awaited baby has SMA Type1. However, after two weeks we noticed unusual arm movements and decided to show Misha to his pediatrician. Misha was quite weak, and the doctor prescribed some test. The ultrasound revealed that he had a residual asphyxia, yet the overall results were good.

On Aug 14th, 2020 we had an appointment with our neurologist where we first time heard presumptive diagnosis - Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 1.

On Sep 2nd, 2020, Misha’s condition was officially confirmed - SMA Type 1, a disease that takes away babies’ ability to talk, eat, sit up and finally breathe.



Our son needs genetic treatment with drug called Zolgensma, the most expensive drug in the World. The cost of Misha’s life is $2.3 million. Misha’s time is quickly running out. Even though Misha is only two months old now, it is critical begin treatment as early as possible in order to stop irreversible motor neuron loss and make the achievement of major motor milestones such as crawling, sitting and walking and even breathing. Medical studies show the tremendous lifechanging impact Zolgensma can have on children with SMA Type 1.

PLEASE keep spreading Misha’s story. We will be FOREVER GRATEFUL for in saving Misha.

Our fight for Misha’s life continues!

New Drug for Canine Osteosarcoma,"$3,165 raised of $10,000 goal","If you are like me, you love your pets deeply.

I am a longtime dog lover. At one point in time, I owned several Irish Wolfhounds, who were a big part of my family's life. So you can imagine the feeling of deep loss we had when on the way home from a vacation we received a call from our friend who was watching the house -

""Ammadon has broken his leg!""

Rushing home, we found our oldest male had quickly taken a turn for the worse. He was running a fever, and his left leg was swollen and at a disturbing angle. Several hours later, we learned not only that he had osteosarcoma, but it had metastasized into his lungs and other organs. The doctor did not give much hope. The treatments were harsh, difficult, and expensive. Ammadon had to be put to sleep not long after the discovery of the cancer.

Sadly, it is estimated that around 10,000 dogs are diagnosed annually with osteosarcoma. The true number of cases is likely higher, since dogs may be put down before diagnosis is established. While it can happen to any dog, it especially impacts large to giant breed dogs. The cause of death for most dogs that undergo amputation is the cancer metastasizing to other parts of the body. Even with the current treatment regime of amputation plus radiation and chemotherapy, few make it to the 2 year mark. Average 2 year survival rate is less than 5% post diagnosis. All of the treatments are very expensive and tend to be painful and/or toxic.

 Allow me to back up and better introduce myself. My name is Ben Pyles. I grew up on a working farm in rural Vermont. Our family also bred Irish Wolfhounds, as well as raising various heritage breeds for livestock. Our dogs were part of the daily fabric of our lives.
Over the years, I have earned a masters in Molecular Biology, a MEd,, and an MBA. I have also been fortunate enough to be part of some truly groundbreaking science over the years.

Fast forward to today: I am now working in a research laboratory with one of the pioneers of immune system modulation, Dr. Heike Wulff. It has been found that one of the drugs she had synthesized a long time ago, called PAP1, looks to be effective at killing osteosarcoma cancer cells- while not harming the rest of the body. Studies have shown that osteosarcoma cells over-express a cell membrane protein called Kv1.3 compared to normal cells - and that PAP1 specifically blocks Kv1.3.  Blocking enough Kv1.3 causes a cascade that reactivates a cell’s natural process of apoptosis. Apoptosis is the “biologically programmed death” process of cells that occurs as a normal and controlled part of an organism’s growth or development. It is an important way the body rids itself of cancer cells when they arise.

But is the drug safe? Well, toxicity studies for Pap-1 have been done in rodents, pigs, macaque monkeys and even humans (topically). The various studies showed low patient toxicity. Very high sustained doses were used and tolerated, with almost no adverse effects reported. 

This treatment has so much promise.  But it has never been studied in dogs. I began to wonder if this would be effective in battling canine osteosarcomas... there are papers that say the target is present in this cancer and going after it is effective in killing the cancer cells.

Can you imagine a drug that can be injected or given orally, that has high tumor toxicity but minimally affects the patient even at high doses? A drug that could be given and dosed across the whole body, allowing the drug to find and interact with all the metastasis or bone cancer present? Can you imagine a small biotech company that would want to develop this drug and produce it for a reasonable price such that most dog owners could give it a try rather than just sadly saying good bye to their companions?

The good news is we can quickly begin to find out. We can try our drug PAP1 on cultured osteosarcoma cells from dogs and see if they die much like the human and mouse cell lines did when exposed to PAP1.  PAP1 has had many years of research backing it, and has been shown to be very safe in other species. Once we show PAP1 works at stopping the cancer cells in a petri dish, we will show that PAP1 is safe for the dogs we wish to treat. We have plans to work with the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine to test our drug on dogs with the ailment.

However, we have to walk before we run, so we need to show that it works in vitro.

That is where you all can come in.

It is hard to get research money through traditional routes for pet applications. This isn’t a normal thing for agencies like the National Institute of Health or National Science Foundation. Also, it has neither the glamour of human drug development, nor the promise of outlandish payouts, the large established pharmaceutical corporations aren't interested in pursuing something like this. They ask “Is this a billion dollar drug”- and I have no respond “no”. But it is a worthy thing to do none the less. My team and I feel saving our four legged friends is a worthy goal and really want to try. After all- we'll never know if this could work if no one tries… and all the current information available says it should work. Will you help us?

Help Josue,"$5,680 raised of $50,000 goal","Hi, my name is Cesar Gonzalez and I am Fundraising for Josue Israel. He is a 3 month old baby and has a condition called Spinal Muscular Atrophy. We are trying to raise $50,000 for a small portion of his medication and treatment. If we can go over that amount it would be great! The amount of money to buy the first dose for Josue is almost complete, and it takes two weeks to arrive. His health is criticaland we hope he resists because it brings a high degree of malnutrition. Since being diagnosed with the disease he has not gained weight, on the contrary, he has lost weight. He weighs 8lbs, and because the medication is only good for two months, we need to get more medication considering he'd be taking the medication for life. The medication is Evrysdi. The other single dose drug is Solgenzma and is very expensive, $ 2.1 million. The neurologist who treats him in Monterrey, Mexico put him on a program to see if he benefits from the drug from a pharmaceutical that produces that medication because they give away doses per year for children who cannot afford it. This medication must be given before Josue is 2 years old. There is another drug called Spinraza, which has to be injected into the spine every 4 months, the cost is $ 750,000 the first year and $ 375,000 annually after. Whatever we can get, the sooner the better. Every day movement neurons die and the longer it takes to get the medication the less chances he has to live. Right now, for example, Josue no longer performs the function of swallowing and has to receive food via a nasogastric tube. If he gets the medication on time, Josue’s damaged organs may start working again.

God willing, we have a lot of faith. Every little thing helps. Thank you

Aunt Sandy VS. Breast Cancer,"$2,010 raised of $2,100 goal","My Aunt Sandy (wife, mother, and grandmother)  was recently diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer after noticing an unusual dimpling in one of her breasts.  Doctors have confirmed that her cancer is triple positive (her, er, pr).  The cancer has spread to her lymph nodes.  She will undergo 5 months of chemotherapy, followed by radiation and another 7 months of chemotherapy.  If the tumor shrinks enough, surgery will be a possiblity.  The herceptin medication alone that Sandy is requried to take is $5,900 per month.  Her only form of insurance is Medicare, which covers 80% of the costs.  The remaining 20% of medical costs will be close to impossible for the family to cover, considering they are struggling to pay the everyday cost of living due to ongoing medical issues that have plagued her and her husband.  Sandy also  suffers from ankloysis spondylitis and spinal stenosis, which is inoperable due to nerve damage.  Her husband has heart disease, and COPD has left him with only one functioning lung.  

We have decided to start a gofundme page to help Sandy so that she is able to focus on getting better instead of worrying about her financial situation.  Please consider any donation amount toward Aunt Sandy's fight against breast cancer.

Later, his family would find out that Marshall had died with extensive injuries- fractured skull, ruptured spleen, several severely broken ribs, and brain swelling, ultimately leading him into cardiac arrest. Even the coroner who spoke with Marshall’s family called the death “suspicious.”

Pastor Teo's Road to Recovery,"$3,227 raised of $10,000 goal","My dad, Pastor Kenneth Teo, was diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer on his left upper lobe on April 2018. This was an incidental finding that surfaced when he had a CT scan done for a non-cancerous mass that had been growing on the right side of his neck. While working to find a provider and getting his medical insurance in order, months passed without any treatment plan. He finally got established with an oncologist at Baylor Scott and White in Dallas, Texas. The oncologist was caught up on my dad's story and ordered a PET scan to see if the cancer had metastasized to any other part of his body. Upon getting an abnormal result from the scan, a bone biopsy was done on November 2018 showing  that his lung cancer had metastasized to the T3 bone of his spine.

Initially, the oncologist wanted my dad to go through numerous rounds of radiation and chemotherapy, in which he would have to travel from his home of Mineola to Dallas every day (1.5 hour car ride each way). He tested the lung biopsy for more specific findings and found that the cancer cells had a specific mutation that could be treated by targeted therapy. He recommended my dad be started on the medication Osimertinib, a new drug that could be used to treat his certain lung cancer by preventing cancer cells from dividing and growing and can cause them to shrink and die.

This therapy comes in the form of a once daily pill. With the newness and effectiveness of the drug comes a high price. A one year supply of this drug would total $15,000 and his insurance can only cover 1/3rd of it, leaving $10,000 for treatment alone. He would also have doctor's visits and scans every 2 months to see if this drug is working.  The doctor also recommended he be put on another drug called Zoledronic acid to support bone strength due to the metastasis. This drug can affect his dental health and jaw bone so the doctor wants to proceed with dental treatment during his cancer therapy that would include complete extractions of all his remaining teeth (cost = $2,000) plus purchase of complete upper and lower dentures (cost = $1,500). 

You couldn't find someone more deserving of help than someone who has given so selflessly in every way possible. My dad has been serving in Christian ministry for the past 33 years. Mercy ministry has always been his passion, with special interest in helping people suffering from drug and alcohol addiction in Singapore. In America, he established a food pantry that has fed thousands of people across Wood County, East Texas, houses the homeless that come through the surrounding community, and served 400 Thanksgiving and Christmas meals each year to those in need for 10 years all while pastoring in a local non-denominational church in Mineola. In 2009, he won the award for Humanitarian of the Year from the Mineola Chamber of Commerce. He's known around the whole community as someone who would take the shirt off his back to help someone in need. If you know him at all, you know that statement to be pure truth. 

As expense on expense piles up, the financial burden of this diagnosis has been increasingly overwhelming to my family.  His battle with cancer has only just begun, but we really can't proceed without the help of our family and friends. Anything you give will go straight to his medical bills, and if you find yourself not able to supply any financial gift, we would sincerely appreciate lots of prayer. We believe that God has control over this situation and will be with us every step of the way.

Love For Our L.A.M.B. (Layla Ann May Bundic),"$11,975 CAD raised of $20,000 goal","Oh, where do I even start… I’m not sure… Asking for help is one of the hardest things to do and never in our dreams did we ever think that we’d be in this position. You never know what life has in store for you that’s for sure.Our names are Suzanne Klem and John Bundic. We are the proud parents of Layla Ann May Bundic (hence the initials “L.A.M.B.” and she really is a sweet little lamb ). Layla is our reason for starting this Go Fund Me page.Layla was born in 2016 and has not had an easy ride right from the start. During labour and delivery (I will spare all of the details as it is a rather long and traumatic story) we required an emergency c-section. Within the time before the c-section Layla’s heart stopped beating and she went without oxygen (she had to be resuscitated). Due to the lack of oxygen, she suffered some brain damage. She was whisked away without her mother even being able to hold her for the first time. It was gut wrenching. Every mother dreams of this moment but I didn’t get that moment until 10 days later and boy was that the most amazing day to finally hold my baby girl in my arms. She had fought so hard just to stay alive. Now, almost 3 years later, she still continues to fight on a daily basis. She fights to do and learn the everyday things that we can easily take for granted. Layla has now been diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy. She was diagnosed at around 1-year with Spastic Quadriplegia Cerebral Palsy. To break that down, it means she has spasticity (tight muscles that are difficult to stretch) in all four limbs and because of this, her gross and fine motor skills have been affected. Within the last 6 months Layla has also started to have seizures. She is now required to take medication to help control the seizures and we have also been prescribed a rescue medicine (which is not covered under my drug plan). At this time there is no cure for Cerebral Palsy.Given that there is no cure for CP we must focus on early intervention and get her muscles moving and stretching through Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy, and Speech Therapy. She has come so far from what we were told she would ever be capable of accomplishing in her early days. She truly is remarkable. In our eyes Layla is such a strong little girl for having the drive and motivation to keep trying. She never gives up and almost always has a smile on her face. Her achievements thus far are amazing. This is a list of the tools that Layla requires to excel:• AFO’s (Ankle Foot Orthosis)• Neoprene Hand and Thumb Splint (daytime) • Thermoplastic Hand and Thumb Splint (night-time)• Walker • Stander• Wheelchair• Eye patches/Drops• Seizure Control Medication • Seizure Rescue MedicationMost of these items have high ticket prices but the benefits of having them far exceeds the cost and therefore we must do whatever it takes to make sure our little girl has these tools so that she can live her best life. With that being said we are swallowing our pride and admitting that we need some financial assistance in order to get these items for her. We have applied to a variety of organizations for subsidies/funding but have either not qualified or the funds available have been depleted already for this year. We just purchased new AFO’s and her custom neoprene hand and thumb splint because she outgrew her last pairs along with her stander and walker which we still need to purchase. We have already depleted our savings. There are no more loans to be had at the bank and we genuinely need some assistance. I do have some benefits through work however they are not that great and they only cover a very small fraction of the high cost. As she grows so do the price tags. She also needs a stander and a wheelchair to be used for long distances and for when she starts school next year. We both work very hard and have even considered picking up second jobs but our little girl needs our time at home to work on developing her skills. On top of all of her equipment, we also need to purchase a new vehicle as her equipment will not fit in what we currently drive and is necessary to get her to and from all of her appointments. We are posting here as a last resort and would really appreciate some support as Layla means the world to us and to so many others. She deserves to shine like the star she is.Thank you for taking the time to read about our journey. Any contributions to show our L.A.M.B. some love would be greatly appreciated and will help us reach our goal of getting Layla the equipment and tools she needs to become a confident and independent little girl.From the bottom of our hearts, love, Layla, Suzanne, and John

Help Fund Dave's Cancer Treatment,"$47,837 CAD raised of $75,000 goal","Hi everyone, my name is Rachel. I met my husband Dave back in August 2006 as I was getting ready to start my final year of high school. I had never been in love before, but he quickly stole my heart. A short 4 months after we started dating, Dave was diagnosed with a rare cancer called alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS), and it has been a part of our lives ever since. Fast forward 17 years, we have accomplished so much together. We got married and have a beautiful, smart, and silly daughter, named Olivia. During this time there have been countless trips to sarcoma specialists in Toronto, many failed treatments, and continued disease progression.

We’ve always had a reason to hold on to hope that Dave would someday beat cancer. The last two years that hope has slowly been slipping away as the cancer has been growing and spreading more rapidly than ever before. While the cancer started off as a golf-ball-sized tumor in his arm, it is now in eight different parts of his body with over 30 metastases. Right now, we’re feeling desperate. We need a solution, and we need it fast. Dave is running out of time and options. His current prognosis is not good, and we’re scared of losing him.

In June 2020, mid Covid pandemic, I was diagnosed with colon cancer for which I had immediate surgery (R-Hemicolectomy, which showed a T4N0M0V1 tumour). I had been largely asymptomatic except for being found to be severely anaemic earlier in the year after a blood test, and just started to develop intermittent episodes of swelling in my abdomen during the spring. After recovering from the operation I subsequently completed 6 months of chemotherapy and we hoped with all our hearts that it would be the end of our cancer journey.

Fox’s FIP Treatment,"$1,257 raised","Fox was found abandoned in a garbage can along with his sister. He and his sister were rescued and they settled in to a comfortable indoor life. Fox’s favorite hobbies include bird watching and eating. Fox loves food and even tries to steal human food if left unattended.

Fox’s symptoms began with weight loss, despite a healthy appetite. After about a week, this food loving boy wouldn’t even eat canned food. He became lethargic and dehydrated. Bloodwork showed several abnormalities, which pointed to FIP and we quickly began treatment. The day after starting injections, Fox developed mydriasis (dilated pupils) and experienced vision impairment.

Cocoa’s FIP Treatment,"$945 raised of $2,000 goal","Cocoa was found as a stray before being adopted into a loving family. Cocoa is an easy going girl who loves to be pet and held. She had only been in her adoptive home for 4 weeks when her new family noticed her breathing became rapid. She wasn’t eating as much and was a little irritable. Cocoa was taken to the vet where bloodwork and X-rays indicated she has wet FIP. 80 mL of fluid was drained from Cocoa’s lungs and FIP treatment was started right away. Thankfully, the quick response from Cocoa’s family and treatment team meant that she could begin treatment before her symptoms became more severe and her situation became critical.

FIP is a viral disease caused by certain strains of the Feline coronavirus. Most strains of feline coronavirus are found in the GI tract. They do not cause major illness and most cats’ immune systems will naturally produce antibodies against the virus. In 10% of infected cats, however, mutations of the virus result in white blood cells being infected with the virus, which then spread to the entire body. The body mounts an intense inflammatory reaction to the infected cells. This interaction between the immune system and the virus is responsible for the development of FIP. Once a cat develops clinical FIP, the disease is progressive and most often fatal, if not treated (Cornell Feline Health Center).

Critical Cancer Medication Needed!,"$1,315 raised of $5,000 goal","Hello,
My name is Wendi, and I have a very rare type of sinonasal sarcoma. I have been misdiagnosed several times, because the type of sarcoma I have, has only been diagnosed in 6 other people in the United States. It is EWSR1:COLA2 Sinonasal Sarcoma. I have been going through treatment for a 3 local recurrences in my head/sinuses, since January of last year. That has included chemotherapy, surgery and I am also getting radiation therapy now, as well. The chemotherapy I am on, Carboplatin and Etoposide, are very harsh drugs, and I cannot stay on them long term. My oncologist would like to change me to an oral medication and a single chemotherapy drug, that is not as hard on my body. However, the copay cost is extremely high. The drug, Votrient, for a month supply is $15,000. I have applied for copay assistance programs, but they take several weeks/months to get approved. I cannot use the manufacturer coupon because I have Medicare, and it specifically states that the coupon cannot be used unless you have a private insurance, not Medicare or Medicaid. If I am able to make this copay, it would buy me time to be approved and it would also get close to my yearly maximum out of pocket cost with my Medicare suppliment. Please, please donate and share if you can. My body and soul are getting so worn down with the current chemotherapy treatment I am taking. Unfortunately, because the cancer I have is so rare, the treatments are extremely limited. I have reached out to other Sarcoma doctors, in other states, and they agree that this medication regime is optimal. Thank you for the love and support.

Please Help with Kyle&#039;s Medical expenses,"$1,910 raised of $65,000 goal","This is my son Kyle. I am his mother, and I am writing to you in hopes that after hearing his story, you can help me raise money for the medical expenses needed for him.  

When Kyle was fifteen years old he was in his first year of high school, a star athlete looking forward to all the opportunities life has to offer.  On April 24, 2010, Kyle experimented with a drug called K2, and fell victim to the ravages of this new designer street drug, synthetic marijuana. After ingesting this drug, Kyle began to experience psychosis; a combination of suicidal thoughts, hallucinations, and complete feelings of discomfort. Caught in the trenches of mind consuming depression and after effects of the drug, Kyle began to feel suicidal and felt that taking his life would be the only escape from his internal troubles; he felt that his life was not worth living anymore.  That day, sitting underneath a tree, he planned to kill himself. Thankfully, in a moment of clarity and complete helplessness, Kyle revealed to his father what he had planned to do. Immediately, we took him to the emergency room where he was placed into an adolescent psychiatric unit. Rather than detoxing Kyle from this drug as I pleaded, the doctors thought it beneficial to place him on four heavy antipsychotic medications. Within a week my son shifted from a functioning human being who was once athletic, handsome, and vibrant, to a shell of a young man void of any happiness.  

One, of our five children, Kyle has always been known as our gentle giant. Prior to his involvement with the synthetic marijuana, he was beginning his freshman year of high school; a thriving young athlete, hopeful for scholarships to college and well liked amongst his peers. He was playful and funny and always mixed well in every situation he was in. Kyle is kindhearted and always helped people, whether at home or on the field. There were never any signs of mental illness, ever. He was a normal, functioning teen until that day in April 2010.      

We have endured four years of devastation and adversity, and I have watched my son digress further from his normal self. The punishment Kyle has had to face for this mistake has robbed him of his youth; a high price to pay for a young man.  

To this date, he has undergone and experienced the following:

He has been hospitalized THIRTY TWO times to acute psychiatric units.  

ONE eight month stay at an Adolescent Residential Treatment Facility, where he has been assaulted several times and stayed drugged his entire stay.

Kyle endured head trauma to his left frontal lobe from being locked into a small concrete room where he was allowed to bang his head for five straight days.      

He has had over THIRTY antipsychotic and antidepressant medications introduced to his system, HE HAS BEEN TREATMENT RESISTANT TO ALL MEDICATIONS.

He has had delirium from the toxic effects of all the anti-psychotic drugs and had to be four point restrained to a bed for days on end.   

He endured TWENTY EIGHT ELECTRICAL SHOCK THERAPY PROCEDURES, which he did not want preformed all due to the toxic effects of the anti-psychotic drugs and to bring him out of the delirium.    

He has attempted suicide TEN TIMES, two attempts were almost fatal.

And he lost all of his young teenage years, and all four of his high school years. 

It’s a very unfortunate place to be in when there is no prior history of mental illness only horrific symptoms brought on by the unintelligent use of anti-psychotic drugs.  He was forced into them and the Electrical Shock Procedures all the while not wanting any of it.  Through Kyle’s experience and my own, my hope would be that people would come to know what can happen in the psychiatric world.  It is horrible and he has paid a high price for what has happened.  We were just told by his doctor that they no longer know how to help him.  

I have been diligent in my efforts through these years to research and get the help needed for Kyle, but to no avail.  I have fought hard and testified before my State Senators and Federal Senators in DC to ban these legal synthetic drugs.  My voice has been heard.  I have teamed with the DEA and have had numerous television interviews by local and state news stations on Kyle’s story. My most recent interview was with Drew Griffin from CNN, and our story was featured on Anderson Cooper 360.  Forbes magazine and Huffington Post have done articles as well.  My hope now is to focus on Kyle and sending him to a specific Residential Treatment Facility that specializes in tapering and detoxing off of psychiatric medications that will eventually kill him if we don’t get him off of them.  There, he will have extensive one on one therapy along with cognitive and neurological rehabilitation, a diet plan, and will be worked with extensively to get him through the trauma he has endured.  This process is unavailable anywhere within my state.  And of course is not covered by insurance.  

The most unfortunate thing is that Kyle has lost his reason for living and essentially his life.  And amidst his despair he lost all his friends and all his high school years.  He never finished his ninth grade year and never had the opportunity to walk across the stage of his high school to graduate. As his mom, I too lost the happiness of seeing my son experience these rights of passage such as graduating, going to prom, or taking senior pictures. That was all taken from him.  But I have hope that his life is not in vain, and that he will soon see a renewed hope for himself and our family.  That he will forever be reminded of the ones who so graciously supported him in helping to re-start his life. 

 Thank you so much for your help! You will never understand how grateful we are to you for your donation, prayers, and support.  We truly need this at this difficult time. 

Sincerely,
Robin Smith

Celia Givens Breast Cancer Meds,"$8,861 raised of $11,576 goal","Celia Givens Breast Cancer Medication

 

This is a difficult letter to write, but we are at a crossroad with a new cancer medication that Celia now requires.  As many of you know, Celia’s breast cancer has returned and metastasized in her bones.  Her oncologist has assured us that the cancer is survivable and drawn up a new battle plan.  However, an oral CHEMO THERAPY DRUG is required that comes with a high price tag.

 

We have established a goal of $11,576. to cover cost

 

We are turning to this online fundraising website in hopes of securing enough money to hopefully bridge the gap between our insurance and what our family can manageably afford.  Any amount would be deeply appreciated.  If there comes a time that Celia’s treatments are no longer needed, we want to assure everyone that any possible remaining money will be donated directly to the American Cancer Society to benefit others.

Daniel (JD) Talton ALS Battle,"$9,560 raised of $85,000 goal","After noticing a little muscle weakness, my husband Daniel (he goes by JD at work), decided to see a doctor. Our lives were changed forever by the diagnosis: A.L.S. - also known as Lou Gehrigs Disease. We've all heard of it, but I didn't really know what it was. It is a Neuromuscular Disease that slowly kills the body's muscles.  My healthy, adventurous, driven husband who exercised daily, ate a healthy diet and could never sit still was given the worst diagnosis that we could imagine. No cure, only 1 drug that only slowed progression for a few months and a 2-5 year life expectancy. 2-5 really tough years. Our kids were 11 and 16 at the time. He has always been so close with them and their hero. The best ""crash test daddy"" anyone could ask for. He never thought about what would happen to him - only about how this  would affect them. They come before everything for him (that includes me, as it should be).  We moved back to south Florida, after living in Houston for 17 years, to be near our families. Both of our kids are proud Native Texans and we were all sad to leave, but it's so nice to be near our siblings and parents again! Everyone says, ""wow, he's such a great guy"", but Daniel really is. He has spent his career helping others and  with the dream of doing his part to make the world a little better for our kids. Even though he knew he would miss our son's 1st birthday, he was excited for the opportunity to serve his country in Iraq and later did the same in Afghanistan. He was one of the first group to respond to New Orleans after hurricane Katrina and stayed there for weeks helping those who had lost everything. We have a file cabinet full of awards and commendations that he is too humble to let me frame. Reading this today will be the first time many of our friends, family and his coworkers hear of this. It is because he didn't want for people to have heavy hearts over him and he doen't want sympathy. If you contact him - don't say ""I'm sorry"". Maybe a ""Dude, that sucks!"".  What he does want is a chance to spend more time with the kids and I.  To return to the job that he loves. The first new ALS drug in 22 years, Radicava, has recently been approved by the FDA. The price tag on the drug alone is $7,500 per week. Infusions are an extra cost and this drug has to be taken for the rest of his life. Our insurance company has stepped up a little, but the out of pocket costs are still high. We have these costs as well as all of the supliments that he takes to keep him strong. We believe the cure is out there and that it's  just a matter of finding the right combination of drugs and supplements. I know that this has been a long read. Believe me, I edited!

New Vision Transitional Living,"$4,405 raised of $10,000 goal","The purpose of this video is to give hope through a brief version of my testimony of how I went from drug dealer, to drug addict, and finally became a drug counselor. My goal is to raise money for a sober living house.
I am a person who comes from a family dynamic that has had struggles with addiction. As an adolescent I began to experiment with and sell drugs. Starting at the age of 13 I went to multiple group homes, juvenile centers and eventually prison for the first time at the age of 18. I went to prison for a second time in 2009 for drug possession. During that stay I began to realize my lifestyle was leading me nowhere, but I felt hopeless as if I had no way out.
My addiction raged on for a few more years until I got sent to the Talbert House where I received substance abuse treatment over incarceration. During my treatment stay I received clinical care, was introduced to the 12-step community, and started down a spiritual path. Upon graduation I went to a sober living house where I learned the skills I needed to put my life in order and restore my family. Eventually after 20 months I moved out and started working at a local treatment center due to my desire to give back what was so freely given to me. While there I was influenced by the education of my peers and decided to go to college to become a substance abuse counselor.

Save Connor,"$1,128,944 raised of $2,000,000 goal","Every parent’s worst nightmare is losing their child. And what if money is the one thing that stands in the way of your child’s chance to live? This is our reality. With your help, we can save Connor.  ***donations are tax deductible***

Our Story:
Our son Connor is an energetic, joyful, and loving 12 year old. And he’s dying. We have one chance to change his fate and it has to happen now. We need your help to save Connor’s life, and children like him. 

When Connor was born, our hearts were so full! We had never loved like this before. He is full of love. He has a brilliant smile and loves sports, especially basketball. He hugs everyone and is unfailingly kind. The world is a better place with him in it.


We started becoming concerned about Connor a few years ago when school noticed that he was falling behind. We started visiting doctors and specialists to get answers. Connor was diagnosed with Autism, which caused us to recalibrate the future we envisioned for him. Little did we know the devastation that lay ahead.

Recently, Type C, a genetic degenerative brain disorder in children caused by a single missing enzyme. It’s the worst disease you’ve never heard of.


Because Connor lacks this single enzyme, toxic storage material is building up in his brain every second and damaging it. As the degeneration rapidly progresses, Connor will stop walking, stop talking, stop being able to feed himself. He’ll develop movement disorders and seizures, suffer severe dementia, endure a lot of pain and suffering, and then he’ll die. All in the coming years.

Today, Connor loves being with his friends who have known him since he was 3-years-old.  Running and playing with them and  his younger brother, Keenan.  Connor loves anything active and outdoors, and plenty of snacks!  We know without a cure, all of this goes away.


Researchers at UT Southwestern in Dallas, TX, are ready to conduct . Research for this gene therapy has shown in pre-clinical models that it can stop the disease. This clinical trial is the crucial step of determining whether earlier research is able to show the same therapeutic benefits in children. 

Millions are needed to fund the final pre-clinical steps, gene therapy drug production for children (aka medicine), and the clinical trial costs. 

and give Connor a chance at growing up, a chance at life. We can’t just sit back and accept that he’s going to fade away and die, not when there is something that could save him.

This campaign for his LIFE is as urgent as it gets.

There is no guarantee Connor will be among the children accepted into the trial. But we have hope and it’s his only chance. And without funding for the clinical trial, his future is certain: death.


A parent’s love for their child is like no other. If you are a parent, you understand.

A campaign like this can grow quickly if supported and if shared with the masses. We can reach this goal if it goes viral!

Every dollar goes to  , a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization helping fund the first-ever gene therapy clinical trial for Sanfilippo Syndrome Type C that can give Connor a chance at life. Donations may be tax deductible. 100% of the funds raised here will go toward the research. We are currently racing against time to fund this trial and get it up and running. It will help Connor and so many other children a chance at life, today and for generations to come.  ***Any donations received above the goal will go directly to Cure Sanfilippo Foundation new research projects in need of funding***




Getting a clinical trial up and running can cost millions of dollars. In rare diseases, large pharmaceutical companies have little interest because they don’t see ways to make a profit. The truth is that it is left up to parents to drive and fund the research for treatments and a cure. This will help fund this specific clinical trial that can possibly save Connor and other children with Sanfilippo. If we can’t fund the clinical trial, it will not happen. And we are nearly out of TIME.




Children’s cognitive abilities are completely taken away quickly once they begin regressing. In time, children regress back to an infantile state, likely never to return. This rapidly-progressive neurodegenerative disease will soon start taking over completely. Connor is 12 years old. We don't want to lose our son. This must happen now.

Kiki Strong,"$2,825 raised of $10,000 goal","On October 1, 2020, 10 year old Kiki Price went to complete routine labs because her Juvenile Arthritis had been flaring up. Shortly after having blood drawn, the Price family received a phone call from Kiki's rheumatologist telling them to take Kiki to the Emergency Room because her hemoglobin, platelets, and white blood cell count were dangerously low. That same afternoon, Kiki was transferred to a hospital in Orlando, where her specialists are - 2.5 hours away from her home. That night, the Price family was informed that Kiki was at high risk for infection and bleeding due to her low white blood counts. Thankfully, leukemia has been ruled out. Doctors have determined that Kiki has a gene mutation that makes her a poor metabolizer for one of her arthritis medications.  This drug is supposed to suppress the immune system enough to keep her arthritis in check, but, instead, because her body cannot metabolize it, it has built up in her system and completely shut down bone marrow production. She is also having an overactive inflammatory response, even though her immune system is suppressed.  Kiki has been undergoing treatment (daily blood transfusions, many medications, IV nutrition, hi-flow oxygen) ever since and is now in the PICU.  Because she also has Down syndrome, Kiki's body chemistry/ genes are different from a typical child, making her case quite unique, so doctors are consulting colleagues around the country to weigh in on her care.  
     Kiki is a sweet and feisty angel who has the most beautiful and contagious smile. She loves to meet people and encourage them with her hugs and compassionate words. She is an example of courage and strength. 
     This is a very scary time for the Price family as they watch their little girl fight to heal and recover. Doctors expect that it will take 8-12 weeks to resolve, and even after she leaves the hospital she will likely need weekly outpatient treatment. She is moving in the right direction, but this type of recovery takes time.  Let's come together as a community and assist with medical, food, housing and travel expenses for the Price family.  If you can, please donate to this fundraiser. If you're unable to make a donation, please consider sharing this page and keeping Kiki and her family in your prayers.  Thank you!!

Deanna's Cancer Treatments,"$9,190 raised of $45,000 goal","My name is Kim and I am setting up this fund for my daughter Deanna in hopes to fulfill her wishes of getting Alternative Treatments in addition to her Chemotherapy.A little history of Deanna’s Journey: In 2009 at the age of 13, just a week into starting her 8 th grade year, we found out that Deanna had a very large mass growing around her left femur bone which was later confirmed to be a rare form of bone cancer called “Ewing’s Sarcoma”. This of course was devastating to our family, not only my daughter was diagnosed but we have been reeling from the diagnosis 6 months earlier of my husband’s Small Cell lung cancer with brain metastasis, which is typically a terminal cancer. Thankfully my husband beat his cancer, but Deanna is still battling hers. She started aggressive chemotherapy immediately for 9 months, we just about lived at Yale New Haven Hospital. Mid way through the chemotherapy the plan was for her to have limb salvage surgery to replace her femur bone with a cadaver bone, rod, plates and screws. Thankfully successful. In addition to getting her treatment, the surgery, and intense physical therapy, she was being tutored at home because she was determined to graduate with her 8 th grade class, and she did! Scans followed every 3 months and we thought she was in the clear for about 9 months until we learned she relapsed in her right lung. It didn’t stop there, since that first relapse and many different chemotherapy combinations, Deanna has relapsed 4 times… both lungs, below her trachea and now possibly in her right hip region. She has undergone many lung surgeries to remove any tumors at time of relapse, lung resections and removal of her lower left lobe, radiation treatments on both lungs and also to her trachea,  all while maintaining passing grades in High School, graduating with her class, and working at Hot Topic. What I can tell you is Ewing’s Sarcoma only has 2 treatment protocols, after that, it is different combos of drugs. There has never been a specific chemotherapy drug for Ewing’s Sarcoma until this year, finally some hope for a CURE! There has been trials set in motion and on their way but will be some time before we even know how effective they will be, especially to someone who has relapsed several times. Deanna has decided that after doing some research into Alternative therapies, this is the route she wants to pursue. We support her decision fully. We have looked at several facilities outside the United States because other countries work with more cutting edge therapies that are not allowed or offered here. We are thinking outside the box because our choices are limited and need to try these while she can. Deanna is not looking for the Band-Aid or to keep her cancer at bay….she wants to be cured, she is in search of her cure! At this present time it is not with traditional chemotherapy alone. She’s done this for 7 years. Unfortunately, this comes with a high price tag because it is not covered by insurance. All out of pocket!! Alternative therapies, holistic medicines or herbal treatments are not even encouraged. In other countries they are and this is where she is at in her journey. We are hoping to raise the funds for her Alternative treatments, travel expenses and any (because you know there usually is), unexpected costs. The treatment will also include therapies to build her immune system back up and get her body strong again. The past 7 years her body has just taken a beating. Whatever way you can show your support we are sincerely grateful, no amount is too small, every gesture of kindness is appreciated more than you will ever know. Also, we ask that you please SHARE this page on FB, or email to friends or however you can spread the word and reach as many people as possible to help her reach her goal.
We THANK YOU in advance for taking the time to read about Deanna’s Journey, for all your generous support,
for continuing to follow Deanna’s progress and mostly for keeping her in your thoughts and prayers!!

"Food, Meds & Insulin for a Disabled Trans Woman","$2,928 raised of $5,000 goal","Hi, my name is Joelle and I am fundraising for monthly food and medication costs. Due to a low salary, high cost of living and high monthly bills, I am consistently having difficulty making ends meet. I have thought of starting this godfundme for months but was too ashamed to do so. After every check is dispersed, I pay a bunch of bills and quickly go into a very small balance on my checking account or sometimes go into the negative. As a result, I do not have adequate funds for groceries. I also am disabled [I am an amputee] and have multiple chronic illnesses, including diabetes. I am also a transgender woman and have faced a lot of discrimination because of this. Due to my chronic illnesses, I take a lot of medications and two different kinds of insulin. There are often times when I do not have money to refill my prescriptions or my insulin. I must do what so many people do nowadays which is ""ration"" my medications and insulin until I can afford them again when I get paid. I know this is a hard time for most people and I understand it is hard to give. There are also so many people in need and I am one of millions in need of assistance. But if you are in a position to give, I would appreciate it greatly. No amount is too small. The $5k is simply meant to keep the gofundme open long term as I do not see this problem improving anytime soon. Thanks so much for considering.

Brad's Brain Battle,"£55,662 raised of £300,000 goal","On 30th June, our beautiful, brave boy Bradley (17yrs) was diagnosed with brain cancer.

Just over two weeks prior (14.06.22) Brad, who has been battling Crohn’s disease since September 2020, was admitted to hospital after waking with a headache, slurry speech and having trouble swallowing and with balance. These symptoms quickly escalated to losing the use of his right side, including his face, and double vision in his left eye. It was believed Brad was suffering a stroke. Time was now critical, but after many tests no evidence of a stroke could be found. Bradley was then blue-lighted to Addenbrookes Hospital where we were told to prepare for a rough few days, but nothing could have prepped us for what we were about to face.

Responding to the Diabetes Crisis in Ukraine,"$61,270 CAD raised of $250,000 goal","Kin Communications Leads Fundraising Campaign in Response to the Diabetes Crisis in Ukraine

There are roughly 2.5 million people living with diabetes in Ukraine, many of whom are Type 1 diabetics that need multiple daily injections of insulin to survive. However, for those living in high-conflict areas of the country, access to life-saving insulin is limited or non-existent. Because insulin is a temperature-sensitive product, quick and safe transportation of the insulin is a top priority, making delivering the drug to areas of conflict a struggle. 
 
In response to this immediate need, Kin Communications, NuGen M.D., Draganfly Inc., and Coldchain Technology Services are working together with Revived Soldiers Ukraine (RSU) to deliver NuGen’s needle-free injection systems and insulin to areas affected by the conflict in Ukraine via Draganfly's Medical Response drones.

Revived Soldiers Ukraine (RSU), a non-profit organization dedicated to providing aid to the people of Ukraine, will use Draganfly's Medical Response Drones to deliver NuGen’s needle-free InsuJetTM injection device, filled with 10 milliliters of insulin to those high-conflict areas of Ukraine in dire and urgent need. 

Insulin has been sourced at a significantly reduced price through Coldchain Technology Services, LLC, to help those in need in Ukraine get access to insulin injections.
 
Kin's immediate goal is to raise , but we ask that you join us as we tirelessly aim to raise . But why stop there. There is an immediate and ongoing need as this country is ravaged by these senseless acts of violence. 

 Every needless death in this war is a crime against humanity.

 Together, we can support Ukraine diabetics in and make a very meaningful difference.

Charlie’s Fight,"$7,344 raised of $25,000 goal","Charlie Price (Charliemander) is a high energy 4 year old, and he has recently been diagnosed with Severe Aplastic Anemia. Essentially what that means is that he has rogue immune cells that are attacking his bone marrow, and causing him to have very low levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This is a very rare and serious condition. There are only about 4-5 Eastern Iowa children are treated for this annually.



The treatment for S.A.A. is pretty intense for the little guy and is going to put a lot of stress on his family. Severe Aplastic Anemia has to be treated in two major phases. The first phase is to eliminate the rogue immune cells that are attacking the body. This will be done with a short round of chemotherapy. The second phase once the rogue immune cells have been removed, is to do a Bone Marrow Transplant. This will require that a bone marrow donor is found for Charlie, and will be a tough process, with a long recovery. Once both of these processes have been performed successfully he will be disease free, and drug free.



The timeline for this whole process to take place is significant. He is currently out of the hospital receiving supportive care for the next 6-8 weeks, as they seek a bone marrow donor match for Charlie. During this time he will have 2 appointments per week, and Charlie will receive blood transfusions any time his platelets, red blood count, or white blood count is too low.



Once the 6-8 week supportive care phase is over, and they have found a donor, Charlie will be admitted to the hospital for the long stay. This is where it gets rough. The first 6-8 days is when he will receive the short, and low level chemotherapy. He will lose his hair during this process, but it will grow back. Then comes the bone marrow transplant. This process, and the two weeks after will be the hardest part for Charlie. It will take extra support and strength to make it through this time for Charlie and the entire family. If everything goes well it sounds like this portion could leave Charlie in the hospital for a total of 6-8 weeks. If there are complications this could obviously be extended.



After this Charlie should have rebuilt his immune system to a point that he can be released home, but under strict isolation rules, and 3 weekly visits to the hospital. Even after this 100 days Charlie will have to have regular appointments for a while, and will have annual checkups to check on this for the rest of his life.



There will be many challenges during this process for the family. Throughout the entire process, from supportive care to recovery will require regular travels to the University of Iowa Children’s hospital. During the chemo and bone marrow transplant Charlie and his Mother (Tanya) will be staying together at the hospital. His father (Michael) and his two older sisters (Kaylie Price 12, Kaycee Price 10) will be staying in Cedar Rapids trying to maintain regular school and work schedules, visiting during weekends, and during more difficult days in Charlie’s process.



Any support provided will go to the following:

Offset Medical Costs
Travel to and from Hospital visits.
Any unforeseen costs associated to treatment.
If any donated funds remain at end of process they will be donated to University of Iowa Children’s Hospital.


Thank you for any assistance you are able to offer the Price family as they support Charlie in fight against S.A.A.

Erika Myrvik - Support with Medical Costs,"$44,896 raised of $125,000 goal","Erika Myrvik,  at 28 years old, is one of the youngest people to be diagnosed with multiple myeloma. Statistically, less than 0.3 % of all multiple myeloma patients are under 30 years old. Multiple myeloma is a blood cancer, or tumor of the bone marrow, involving white blood cells that produce a distinctive destructive protein in the blood. This GoFundMe page is entirely dedicated to helping Erika Myrvik pay her health and medical bills. 

Since October, Erika has been in a great deal of physical pain. Initially it was thought to be caused by the sudden transition to working from home full-time or the lack of physical activity in quarantine brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. She began eating clean, attending weekly physical therapy and massage appointments, and focused entirely on caring for her body and mind—unfortunately, nothing helped. Her symptoms of joint and bone pain disguised themselves at first as hypermobility syndrome but, instead of getting better, they continued to worsen. 

After further lab work was done, her medical team saw her serum protein was dramatically elevated and that she was anemic, pointing to multiple myeloma. They were utterly shocked given her age but did further studies with a bone marrow biopsy to confirm the diagnosis that was feared.

Her journey will be long and perilous, as her diagnosis is lifelong. It is treatable, but not curable. The deterioration in bone mass is wreaking havoc on her mobility with walking becoming exceedingly difficult, as well as extremely  painful. Her loss of bone is extensive, causing multiple fractures as the cancer eats away at her bones. She has had a plate placed in her left arm to prevent it from fracturing,  and her sternum, that has fractured twice, has also been recently stabilized with a plate.

There will be multiple surgeries in her future, 16 weeks of chemotherapy, radiation to help stop the spread of cancer in her arms and legs, and an extensive lifelong, multi-drug regimen. With the hope of getting her cancer under control, they will perform a bone marrow transplant, chemically killing off all her bone marrow, further placing her at grave risk due to infection. Then after harvesting her own stem cells, returning them to her to replace what had been destroyed, in hopes of full remission.

She was about to complete her final class prior to college graduation but had to withdraw urgently to address her deteriorating health. She is currently on short term disability from work and hopes to go back as soon as she is able, but her medical bills are mounting, and maintaining health insurance has become a major focus. 

Costs for this disease will continue over her lifetime.  So far, radiation with 10 treatments (just the beginning) for her arm and legs totals $37,000.  Her chemotherapy expense is $28,000 weekly per treatment. Her bone strengthening medication is $8,300/treatment.  Surgery for her most recent left arm plate placement was $120,000, and we have yet to see the bills for her sternum plate surgery in early February, which included 2 weeks of hospitalization.

 We really want Erika to focus all her attention and energy on getting well and going into remission, not on how she is going to address her overwhelming medical and financial challenges.

On behalf of Erika and her family, we appreciate any financial support, no matter how small, that you can offer. She is so appreciative of the outpouring of love, prayers, meals and support shown to her over these past few weeks.  We are all beyond grateful.

In addition, Erika has started an Instagram blog to document her journey, provide personalized updates, and raise awareness for her condition. You can follow along at www.instagram.com/mymultiplemyeloma.

Epilepsy Medications for Christmas,"$1,665 raised of $1,900 goal","  
1 out of 3 people with Epilepsy are pharmacoresistant, meaning their seizures are not controlled with one or multiple medications.






 The most difficult part was the constant experimenting of different medications in search of one that might help to control the seizures, and the things that trigger them.

For me, those triggers are loud noises, flashy or bright lights, shaking or vibrating sensations, and stress. Ironically, I work in the live music industry (concerts and festivals) where bright lights and loud sounds are unavoidable. My condition hinders my performance and often prevents me from working.  

I have taken dozens of medications at various dosages with no significant improvement to my condition. Many of the medications came with unpleasant and sometimes dangerous side effects.

 A few months ago my hospital gave me samples of some medications that were relatively new to the market (Aptiom, Lyrica and Fycompa). When I added them to my existing regimen, the seizures stopped.



Unfortunately two of these medications are not covered by my healthcare provider, due to the high prices charged by pharmaceutical companies. The samples I was given ran out and I could not afford to purchase more.

Cases like mine are becoming more common. Rising prescription prices in America are draining the wealth out of middle class families forcing them to cut spending in other areas or to stop taking the medications. (See Consumer Reports)





I am now in the position of having to choose between buying medications for myself, or having a Christmas dinner and presents for my son and family. I have never had a seizure free holiday with my son, Aiden.

 A gift from you will directly purchase the medications Albiom and Fycompa over the holidays.  Thank you in advance for your support.

Legal fund to stop zoning change for shelter,"$7,625 raised of $15,000 goal","Shoreline City Council and King County are looking to establish a ""low barrier"" (aka ""enhanced"") shelter at 16357 Aurora Ave. N. in Shoreline, WA. This location would house up to 60 or more people. 

A ""low barrier"" shelter is one with extremely few rules. 

- The patrons usually have untreated mental health and/or untreated drug addiction issues. 
- There is no screening for violent persons or sex offenders and ID's are not required. 
- Weapons are not allowed, but the facility does not search for them. 
- Patrons are not required to seek treatment and they are not required to participate in any programs to work towards stable housing. 
- The organization set to run this program has zero experience in running a low barrier shelter. 
- This organization has only had a 20% success rate in getting people to a point they can get into housing and many of those successes were families which is very different from the population that will be here.

According to the current laws of Shoreline a shelter of any kind be placed in a residential zone, which is what this property is. This rule was created just two years ago. The city is trying to pass an ""interim regulation"" which would allow low barrier shelters in some R-48 residential zones including, but not limited to, this location. 

After some research on the subject it became clear that the city's methods and actions were in violation of several laws and processes. We have tried addressing the City Council about these issues ourselves but were getting nowhere. 
As a result, we have been in contact with an attorney that specializes in zoning law. He has confirmed our research. I am not sure what this will cost. It will depend on the City's response once these errors are pointed out to them.

Anything people want to contribute to help us with the burden of these costs is appreciated. There are laws and rules in place that the city must follow. They be allowed to circumvent them.

Help Nicole receive her cancer treatment!,"$51,682 CAD raised of $100,000 goal","The Quick Story: (more details below)
  Hi friends!
  Since my breast cancer diagnosis in January, 2021, I have completed IVF, 8 rounds of chemotherapy, 16 rounds of radiation, a double mastectomy and 6 cycles of oral chemotherapy. Because of the nature of my type of cancer, chances of recurrence are higher than average. A recurrence is when the cancer metastasizes to another part of your body, making it incurable. In order to significantly reduce these chances, a breakthrough medication called Olaparib (trade name Lynparza) has been recommended to me by my oncologist. This medication has been approved for breast cancer in many countries, but not Canada. Currently it has only received approval here for ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancer.  This means that it is not covered for breast cancer patients by our healthcare system. The price of this drug is between $5,000 and $10,000/ month for one year, depending on my dose and any future coverage.

Save Gayla's Life,"$154,312 CAD raised of $200,000 goal","By now, some of you know the situation with our Mom, Gayla Derges. 

In late October, her plan to be present for the birth of her newest grandson was hijacked by abdominal pain that landed her in the hospital. After investigating, they found a tumor had returned and the diagnosis was one no one wants to hear.

She has Ovarian Clear Cell Carcinoma OCCC. This is a rare disease that researchers are struggling to understand. They realize that it does not respond to the treatment used for other ovarian cancers.

She had a surgery on Nov 14th to remove the tumor after which, her Oncologist told her there is an 80% chance it will come back. Each recurrence is more aggressive. The usual treatment for it only has a 17% response rate.  Not good.

Our Aunt Vicki, who spent her career as an MD, checked protocols from other Canadian centres and this is standard treatment under Canadian health care.

She's checked all the clinical trials for novel drugs to treat this and she doesn't qualify for any in North America.

We have checked out Integrative medicine and Naturopath options both local and international. No stone has been left unturned. 

The good news is that in that search, we did find a place in Scottsdale, Arizona that has an amazing track record with late stage cancers and has worked with this particular cancer with great results. They use the newest genetic guided treatments to tell them what drugs the tumor is responsive to and if necessary they can sensitize Gayla's own immune system to fight the disease.

This is very exciting and we're so grateful to have Vicki, who actually understands all the medical language, acting as her advocate to navigate this confusing world. We don't know what we would do without her!

The other good news is that this cancer is not late stage, BUT left untreated it will go that way and we're simply not ready to say good-bye to our sweet Mama. She's young, vital, has grand babies to snuggle and a lot of life in her if we can only beat this hurdle!

The hurdle for us to get her into this treatment center is that it has a hefty price tag. Depending on what they need to use it could be as much as $200,000USD! This is just the treatment and not the travel, accommodations and time away from work.

If you know Gayla, you also know that she had a fairly substantial unexpected expense when she learned that her house was on a landslide, twisting apart and slowly moving to the valley floor. She was left with the choice to walk away from her home or move the house from the landslide onto a different lot. Neither of which were good options. She ended up losing about $600K in that situation and when we suggested fundraising to help her then, she refused. 

This time, we're taking the lead and making this happen and she's finally surrendered to the fundraising help.

There's no way were going to let her miss out on this life saving treatment! We're not done with her yet!

We are calling upon our friends and family to rally together and pitch in anyway you can so we can get her to this treatment center.

Every dollar counts and as her mom always said: ""Many hands make light work."" She was always right about that! 

If everyone pitches in we can do this. Whatever you can afford to gift her financially is appreciated! Then can you please share this go fund me with your community?

With your help, we are certain we can reach our goal. 

Gayla's the first person to help when she can, let's return the favor and save her life!

Her initial assessment is January 13th - 15th and the five - six week treatment would start right away.

It's pay as you go so we don’t have a lot of time to take action. 

I know we have love and generosity in our hearts.

Thank you from the bottom of ours.

Help Support Hannah,"$2,520 raised of $80,000 goal","The Norris Family has always been near to my heart.  While I don't see them on a regular basis now Lisa and I are still friends on social media, and I've been following her posts about her daughter Hannah.  I'll let her tell the story below, but I will say... I've been reading them and the other night I was moved to message her about starting this for her.  She was SUPER hesitant and isn't the best at asking for help.  But the time has come, there aren't other options.  If you or anyone you know has struggled with Mental Health, you know the system is broken.  Lisa has been literally fighting to save her daughters life.  Hannah has been inpatient at NCH for over 2 weeks. She cannot stabilize this time. She has not gone 48 hrs there without needing to be restrained to keep from hurting herself or someone else.   She needs care that she cannot be given there.  But of course that comes with a HIGH dollar price tag.   Hannah is covered by private health care and by caresource but those do not cover the room and board portion of her care which is $13,000 per month out of pocket.  The program requires a minimum of 6 months payment up front to admit her.  Lisa has researched every out of state program/facility and/or every other option.  This is where she's landed; come up with $78,000 (at least) or turn over custody to Children's Services and they'll fund the program--but she will be thrown back into a foster home.  With people that know nothing about her, that may not care for her or push for her care.  Can you imagine if this was your child?   I know it's a big goal.  But every dollar helps.  The internet is a powerful place and we can all support each other.  

Here's a message from Lisa: 

We need your help. My daughter, (Aubrey) Hannah is 12 years old and currently in the fight of her life at Nationwide Children’s Hospital. In a very abridged version of her struggles, she was adopted by my ex-husband and I at age 16 months from the Franklin County Children’s Services’ foster care system. I am a veteran Special Education Teacher and am very well-networked and our daughter has received the absolute best of care, every therapy imaginable, and has a loving network of family support. However, she experienced a significant amount of trauma before the age of 2 and her current diagnosis include Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD) with Dissociative Features, ADHD, Anxiety, in-utero drug and alcohol exposure, and DMDD. She is experiencing an increase in her mental health instability due to puberty triggering previous abuse memories also. Hannah is currently too violent to maintain in our home. We have worked with Family and Children’s First Council, NCH, her fantastic therapy team at Syntero Counseling, and Franklin County Children’s Services to find solutions for her care. We have explored and been declined from over 70 options to date, nationwide. Her current clinical team is recommending a residential treatment center and she has been accepted to Cincinnati Children’s Hospital for this program. We carry United Health Care private insurance as well as Hannah having Caresource through post-adoptive services. Both insurances cover the medical portion of her care at 100%- however, the room and board portion of her care is still $13,000/month out of pocket. The program is demanding 6 months guaranteed funding upfront to admit her (the average, not necessarily complete, cost of treatment). We are being told that in order to get care, we must turn over custody of our child to Franklin County Children’s Services and they will fund the program’s cost. The insanity there is overwhelming, especially considering that IT WILL COST THE COUNTY THE SAME, they have the same program options, and she will lose her private insurance, as well as the control of her care being in the hands of those who love and know her best.

Even FCCS agrees this is NOT what they want to do, but they have no vehicle in place to fund care at that level while allowing us to maintain custody. We have exhausted available MSY funding through Family and Children’s First Council- a program created to prevent families from having to turn over custody of their children to Children’s Services to afford care. We are not the only family faced with this insane choice. We have exhausted the current Post-Adoptive Support funding through FCCS to families. While our current FCCS team has been wonderfully supportive, their hands are tied, and FCCS’ supervision of Hannah’s foster placement prior to her coming into our home was negligent and resulted in substantial additional trauma, so to return to an overcrowded, understaffed system as her “parent” is terrifying. Ohio Medicaid is in the process of creating OHIO R.I.S.E. to address this horrific systemic funding and services gap, but my daughter is out of time. Her life literally depends on systems change and funding support NOW. I’m begging for any and all help you can offer. If our child had a life-threatening physical condition, we would never be told to give up custody to afford her care. She would never be turned away from over 70 facilities.

My child is mentally “bleeding out” and we are rendered essentially helpless to stop it due to systemic red tape and lack of resources. I refuse to accept that as permissible. We have fought the effects of childhood trauma for my bright, funny, athletic, artistic, survivor for 12 years and have worked endlessly to give her the life she deserves. Hannah needs you now.

Thank you for any and all support you can provide! We refuse to give up. Our daughter is worth it! Thank you!!!

I am Father Henri Imad, and I have created this page to request financial assistance for a life-saving drug that is urgently required for my niece Gabrielle, daughter of the late Tony Imad and my sister Hoda, in Lebanon. Due to the current economic crisis in Lebanon, obtaining medicines is extremely challenging. Gabrielle has Cystic Fibrosis and she is facing digestive problems (atrophic pancreas).

In addition, recently she is facing shortness of breath and progressive disease in her lungs. Managing this genetic disease progression and keeping Gabrielle healthy requires ongoing medical care, including genetic treatments such as Trixacar, which can assist in preventing her lungs from damage and avoiding lungs transplant that can be caused by her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Treating her with Trixacar can change her life and prevent her from dying. It will replace the work of genes.

The Spiro Family Cancer Journey,"$93,665 raised of $65,000 goal","Dearest Friends & Family,

As many of you know, my most favorite human in the world, my beautiful dad, Mark Spiro has been in a head-to-head battle with Stage 4 Lung Cancer for almost 2 years. After his first chemotherapy treatment in May of 2022, he was admitted into the hospital for sepsis, where he went into a coma-like state for 2 weeks. We prayed for a miracle, and got one. After recuperating in the hospital for 5 weeks we were finally able to take him home and continue treatment. Since my Dad couldn’t walk or take care of himself and was up most of the night in hallucinatory states, my sister and I moved him and my mom into our apartment to give him the around-the-clock care he needs. We set him up in my sister's room, she slept with me in my room, and my mom on our couch. For the last year and a half, all of us have slept under one roof, where we have focused on my dads healing, safety and recovery to a fierce degree.

Transport to Christie Hospital,"£10,798 raised","Hi, I'm Tracey (aka Cherry Morrello). In January 2021 I was diagnosed with Stage 4 Bowel Cancer. My primary tumour is in my rectum with mets in my liver, lungs, and kidney. In 2021 I went through some extremely torturous chemotherapy with the hope that it would treat my cancer. I was told after the first type of chemo in June 2021 that my cancer wasn't responding to the treatment and I was now terminal. I started on a new regime with the hope that this might work. It didn't. I started on my final chemo in October 2021 and in December 2021 just before Christmas, I was told there was nothing more that they could do for me treatment-wise at the Royal Derby Hospital. At the suggestion of my psychologist, I sought out a second opinion from The Christie Hospital in Manchester. They are a cancer specialist hospital that carries out clinical trials. I was accepted on a trial that was running and I just needed to go up to Manchester to fill in the paperwork. In January 2022 I was hospitalised for 3 weeks due to cancer spreading into my spine. During this stay in the hospital, the trial closed and I was no longer going to be part of it. I was devastated. There was hope. The Professor who was running the trial told me there was a possibility that they would be able to request the drugs from the drug company, Roche, on a ""compassionate"" basis. This would mean I could have the drugs but I didn't get any of the benefits like travel expenses etc. This brings me to my humble request. I have been lucky enough to have a driver take me to my appointments once every three weeks. This has previously been paid for by a friend, however, the funding has now been pulled and I am unable to cover the costs myself. I haven't been able to work since diagnosis and if my husband takes me he loses pay. The cost per trip is £500. The cost is so high because he drives me to Manchester, sits and waits for me all day and then is waiting outside for me when I stumble out after treatment. Our day normally starts with him picking me up at 7 am, getting me safely to the hospital, waiting for me in the hospital car park whilst I have my treatment and dropping me off at home at whatever time. It's been as late as 10:45 pm in the past. I'm so grateful to have Shayad as we have built up a friendship. We chat about everything on the journey to the hospital. Not so much on the way back. Although my driver Shayad is a wonderful person, I'm fully aware that whilst he's waiting for me to have my treatment, he is unable to do other work as he has no idea what time I will be ready to go home. That means he can't utilise that waiting time to earn money. He chats with me on the way to the hospital knowing I'm anxious and leaves me to my senses on the way home when he knows I'm tired. He is a big part of my cancer journey and I would love to be able to continue to have him drive me for my treatment every three weeks. I have been told that the treatment can continue for as long as it is working. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. If you could spare anything, I would be so grateful. If you want to follow my journey on twitter, its a warts and all account of my life, living with cancer. My twitter account is @CherryMorrello

We Rise By Lifting Others.,"$3,645 raised of $3,500 goal","Hello all! This is Carolyn Byerly and 2018 has been an extremely difficult year for our little family (Brian, Kieran, and I); financially, emotionally, and health wise. At the end of August, Brian lost his therapist job unexpectedly at the hospital. Brian made all the money in our family, as I am a stay at home mom to our three-year-old son Kieran and not able  to work because of my complex and ongoing health concerns. Just this year alone, I have been hospitalized 4 times. As of early September, we have been struggling to make ends meet. We have no insurance, because Cobra was astronomically high in price. $2,400 a month and we haven't even received the paperwork to sign up even if we could afford it! We did apply for Medicaid but are anxiously waiting for my hopeful acceptance. I desperately need help to pay for the ongoing health care. I usually see exceptional experts in my team weekly. Unfortunately, that has ended. I need continued care and my health debts from many years ago till present day are over $20,000 and counting. I also require daily medications, including my life saving drug Eliquis for my lung blood clots. This medicine runs over $1,000 without insurance. I have applied for the Rx assistance program, but like other circumstances, I'm still waiting to be accepted. Kieran is thankfully healthy but needs his wellness check and flu shot.  Brian has had a few interviews which have been positive, but the process is painfully slow. We need help now. All unemployment services in North Carolina has been delayed by hurricane Florence. Therefore, we have not received any unemployment benefits. Brian also has an abscess in his throat which has yet to be addressed. They want him to go to an ENT specialist, but that is just unrealistic at this time. Two car payments, food, gas, power, car insurance, and minimum credit card payments have been stretched to the very limit. Even with payment plans, we still cannot meet our needs. We're beyond terrified and anxious.  Last month, we believed with constant prayer, and our commitment to each other and Kieran, we would find a way out. Every day is another 24 hours of worrying and trying to find solutions. We keep our strong faith alive, but now I am asking all of you for any help or prayers you could provide during this crisis in our lives, Even the strongest of us have moments when the burdens of life seem too great. If you can't donate, we thank you for prayers and taking time to read our story. Any bit helps, as we just try to make it one more day and hope to pay for our basic necessities, medical appointments, and prescriptions  as we go. God bless you all. More importantly, thank you. ""Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.

Gratefully,

Help Jonathan live life to the fullest,"$10,026 raised","“This is the hardest thing I have ever done in my life—much harder than any snow mountain I’ve climbed or adventure I’ve done. I almost died.”

First, we want to thank you everyone for praying faithfully and consistently since we first found out that Jonathan contracted Malaria. We were very encouraged to know they are prayer warriors over every continent battling alongside us in prayer. We know it is because of your prayers we have made it so far.

On  February 19th Jonathan began to have a fever, diarrhea, and cold chills. On Feb 21, he went to the hospital and was diagnosed with severe Malaria and an ameba infection. What we didn’t know was that though the Malaria was being treated it has already impacted the kidney which went undetected, causing non-stop hiccups. After living with no sleep and consistent hiccupping for 5 days, he was admitted to the Agah Khan University Hospital, the best private hospital in Kenya. Since then it has been an uphill battle with two failing kidneys, fever, water-logged lung and body. Praise God, on March 2nd Jonathan experienced the turning point! His fourth kidney dialysis was a success and was revived! It has been a true experience of the death and resurrection. Now he is on the slow journey of recovery and we are hopeful that in 3-6 weeks he will regain his health.


Unfortunately, good health care comes at a high price and his current medical expenses average around 1000 USD a day, which is way beyond our budget.

 Would you be willing to join us in this journey both with prayer and financially?

We deeply appreciate your support and any leftover money fundraised will go towards our travel ministry

This is Jonathan's testimony:

On March 2nd I felt I was at the lowest point of my life. I haven’t slept for 5 days due to a constant hiccup that wouldn’t go away. I was given a stronger medicine to stop my hiccup, but it is also a psychotic drug which made me feel even more anxious and made my heart race to 130-140 even lying down. As I wasn’t able to pass urine, my lung started to drown itself in water, but no one told me what was happening so I felt I had no air in my lung. At one point, I felt I will die from lack of oxygen as I gasp for air from the constant hiccups and was getting ready to say goodbye to Annie, my children, and my parents.

Earlier that day, I woke up in the middle of the night during the toughest night of my life. I woke up as if God had touched my body and woken me up. He assured me that he will rescue me. I felt peace for the first time. There was a shift in the spiritual atmosphere.

Then at 5pm, there was a turning point. I went for my 4th dialysis. We were given a nice bed with a table to watch movie and also enjoyed a delicious dinner while doing the dialysis. Right after the dialysis, I had a really nice long urination, first time in 2 weeks. I begin to feel more energy, appetite after passing urine for the first time!! Praise God! God answered your prayers to pass this critical milestone.

I was sleeping at a non-private ward so Annie wasn’t able stay overnight. We were hoping to be dropped off at a private room but after the nurse tried calling around, she told us that I will still stay at the general ward. I was feeling despair to go through another night by myself. But when we got to the general ward, we were told the good news that a private just opened up! We were so joyful because God answered our prayer and your prayers. The night before when I was alone in the ward hiccuping not able to sleep, I told myself I would never want to go through this for another night.

So on March 2nd, I moved from life-critical phase to recovery phase. My kidney is still not functioning well requiring constant dialysis. Please pray my kidneys will continue to improve and pray for donation to cover these unexpected expense. We estimate the total cost will be around US$ 20,000.

Please continue to pray. Your support has made such a difference.

Jonathan

Drug treatment,"$1,665 raised of $5,000 goal","September 23rd is the day my precious prodigal son Tyler was taken away from me. He died from an accidental opioid overdose. I received the call no parent ever wants to get on a sunny Sunday morning. Tyler would not wake up. We raced to his apartment and I witnessed the paramedics perform CPR for 45 minutes. I knew it was too late. He lay there lifeless covered in vomit, an image I will never forget. He was gone and I was in shock. It feels as if it was yesterday. Time does not heal like they say. You just have to try and figure out how to live with it. Tyler’s spiral into drugs started when a “friend” offered him pain pills at a concert. This was the beginning of the end. Tyler said the feeling took all of his anxiety and worries away. It was such a feeling of well being. After awhile he was hooked. Not because the pills made him high but because if he stopped he would become extremely ill with flu like symptoms on steroids he said and horrible body cramps. He was doing it to feel normal and not get sick. I have heard all of the negative comments and hate from people that say well it was his choice! Yes he did make the choice that night but for him it triggered those addiction receptors in his brain. Many people drink alcohol but why do some people become alcoholics? Many people gain weight and eat the wrong foods so why do some become diabetics? Tyler wanted so bad to stop and lead a normal life. He tried many times. Went through 5 treatment centers always started out well sometimes much longer than others. He got hurt severely years ago almost losing his foot. After trauma vascular and orthopedic surgery he was given pain meds again and again and the cycle kept repeating itself. After awhile the doctors cut him off and when he couldn’t afford pills on the street he turned to heroin because it was cheap and easy to get. 10 years his entire family went through hell with this horrible demon!! No one is immune from this horrible disease. Opioids do not care who you are! It can happen to any family. It just doesn’t affect poor broken families and neighborhoods. We never in a million years thought this would be something we would have to deal with. The stigma that came with it made it very hard to talk about. He was treated poorly when he would go to doctor or ER seeking help. I witnessed myself the rudeness and non caring cynical hospital staff. I always had to be there to stand up for him and be his advocate. There were times he was treated well. Tyler shed many tears wanting to figure a way out of this lifestyle. Tyler had so much potential and afun personality and craved to live a normal life again. He just started taking classes at community college and had a job he enjoyed. Tyler was a new dad to a one month old little boy.

my reason for raising money is to give someone the chance to receive inpatient treatment who otherwise would not be able to afford it. There are many kids out there who do not qualify for state insurance to pay for treatment. Many don’t have insurance at all and do not have the means to pay and their families are unable to afford the high price. Many do have private insurance and are unable to afford the out of pocket costs to a treatment center. This money is due before the person enters the facility and is often 1000’s of dollars. I want to help a man between the age of 18-26 years who is ready for treatment and ready to change their lives that do not have the financial means to get into a private long term facility. The program they enter must be a long term treatment center of at least 3 months. They must be dual diagnosis. That means they have medical staff and psych providers that diagnose and treat mental disorders such as depression and bipolar at the same time. The majority of these kids are self medicating an underlying untreated mental disorder. My reason for these requirements is because I have gone through this hell for 10 years and have way too much knowledge and understanding of the very broken system. I know what works. 30 days in a facility does not work for most people. It’s not near enough time to heal the brain. Please help me to help someone in need. This means so much to me if I could save just one family from having to bury their child. Thank you for reading my story and God bless❤️

My daddy needs our help,"$1,960 raised of $10,000 goal","The past 6 months have been the most terryfying and most difficult time of our familys life! My daddy, the love of my life, my rock was diagosed with stage four terminal lung cancer. I remember the day like it was yesterday. We knew the news was going to be bad but we never prepared to hear the words terminal. How do you process that, what do you do? As the Dr. read the results we both just stared at each other, not saying one word, because what words would be right. I remember saying in my mind over and over ""Be strong, be strong"" but then out of nowhere I blurted ""Daddy, what am I going to do, I am so scared I can't lose you"". Tears streamed down my face and he came over and put his arms around me hugging me so tight and cried as he told me it was going to be alright In that moment my whole life flashed before my eyes, everY memory I have is with him. He was there to cheer me on in every thing I ever did, he was there the day both my kids were born and has helped me to raise both of them. He watched me graduate from college and helps me every step of the way never once letting me fall. How can a person process losing someone so important.
My dad has never been much of a planner, he has no savings and is relying solely on social security to get by. The Dr suggested that we start chemo right away to help prolong his life as much as possible, so on July 18th 2015 he started his first round of chemo. Shortly after his first round they discovered liasions in his brain and it was found that he had brain cancer. So The last week of July we started our first round of cyber Knife which is a brand new type of radiation that attacks the cancer head on, and after 4 treatments he went into remission from the brain cancer.
 After completing three cycles of chemo for the lung cancer  the Dr told us it did not shrink the tumor and so we were going to try s new drug called opdivo. This drug has just been approved by the FDA and because of that is very pricey, $120,000 a month tom be exact. Thankfully we have been accepted for a grant that will cover most of the expenses but not all. There is a possibility that if the Opdivo works that dad will be able to receive radiation, which will require him to be in Vegas Five days a week for up to six weeks.
He is too proud to ask for help and for the most part so am I but being a single mother of two kids money is tight and commuting to Las Vegas every two weeks for treatment is getting very expensive. No price is too high because after all it is my papa bear and I will move every mountain to get him better so that we have as much time with him as possible.
 He is a great man and an amazing father and I wish I was in a better position to help him fight this finacially but I am not so any little bit will help. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking the time to read this and god bless!

Baby Ted Chadwick's Fight Against SMA Type 1,"£33,960 raised of £50,000 goal","Hi. We are Dani and Louis. We are the proud parents of Ted, our adorable baby boy. In September of 2023, Ted was diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 1, which for those unfamiliar with the disease, is a very rare genetic condition that affects the central nervous system -- one that is imperative for all life. Since he was diagnosed, our lives have been turned completely upside-down. Dani and I had to stop working to be with Ted full-time and to take on the costs of his medical care.

We’re here telling our story to so the wider community can get an understanding of this terrible disease and the burden it places on the family to cover huge costs not covered by any health service.

Mount Sinai COVID-19 Response Fund,"$21,458 raised of $21,000 goal","Hi all. It’s my birthday today, and for the next 7 days, I will be hosting a fundraiser to help provide ventilators and masks to the frontline healthcare workers at Mount Sinai, the hospital where I work.

I am a clinical researcher on the thoracic oncology team. My patients, who are already extremely sick with stage III and stage IV metastatic lung cancer, are the most vulnerable demographic of patients in the world because of the nature of COVID-19 as a respiratory illness. Simply put, if my patients get COVID-19, they will likely die. Regardless of what you have heard on the news on or TV, the picture inside the hospital is bleak. We are losing more doctors and nurses every day. Every morning, I walk into the hospital and it feels more and more like a warzone. My direct colleagues are going down sick and there is a strong likelihood that I will as well. I am the lead research coordinator on one of the COVID-19 drug trials and although we are trying to fast-track the trial and get FDA approval as soon as possible, this process takes close to a year and we cannot wait for a vaccine to be produced.

Because of this, we are treating patients with standard medications. Thus, the work of nurses, doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, respiratory therapists, and other frontline providers becomes even more important. Unfortunately, the global shortage of masks and ventilators has increased the price of these materials and made them more and more difficult to get. A box of n95 masks, the highest-grade mask that healthcare workers need when dealing with COVID-19 patients, is normally around $20. The price has spiked 1000% as shortages occur and we are facing a reality where healthcare workers simply will not have the protection they need. Furthermore, ventilators—machines used as a last resort to save patients who are unable to breathe on their own—are in short supply.

Disregarding any talk of politics or actions that the government could be taking to mitigate this shortage, the simple truth is that hospitals need money to be able to purchase supplies at such high costs.

Providing hospitals with masks and ventilators will save the lives of healthcare workers as well as people just like us - suddenly torn away from their normal lives who face the prospect of dying in a hospital bed, unable to see or speak to their family, immediately shipped to a mobile morgue and replaced by another dying patient.

I’ve spoken to many people my age who are looking for ways to help during this crisis and a donation here is the easiest and most effective way of doing so. Please send this to your friends and family. Text me at [phone redacted] or email at [email redacted] if you have anything to add or can think of any other way to help. I have direct access to frontline workers and the hospital administrators of the largest health system in the state and can pass on a message if needed.

Help the Stoodley family start over in a safe home,"$5,665 raised of $25,000 goal","My name is Lisa Stoodley, my husband is Tim, and we have a 4 year old daughter named Meira. Our 3 senior pets are Noodle, Lily Mae and Bee. And we are currently in a living nightmare. It is very difficult for us to ask for help, but at this point we are desperate and are willing to explore every avenue we can think of to find the help we need to move forward in a positive way and to solve our problem. In a nutshell, we are essentially homeless, due to no fault of our own. We are living in a camper on my parents' property in North Springfield and are permitted by the town to stay here until November 1st. We are unsure of where we will go after that.

Although our story is a lot more intense and involved than what is portrayed here, the following is an abbreviated version of our experience. I understand that even this shortened version is quite long. But I feel it's important to share the most pertinent details so it is clear that we have been doing our very best to avoid having to ask for help.

Here is our story. We owned a sweet home in Springfield, Vermont, that we all loved. During our last year there, the neighborhood took a turn for the worse with increased drug activity and violence. When we found a needle in the road near our driveway, it was the last straw. We needed a safe place to raise our daughter. She is our world and her well being is our top priority. Due to our financial constraints, we were unable to get a traditional mortgage, and instead received private financing from family members. We found an ugly house in a lovely neighborhood in Springfield that we were told by the realtors and our inspector was a solid house that needed only cosmetic updating. We believed we could fix it up and make it a cute, comfortable home for our family. We closed in November of 2020. The night of the closing we found mold, moisture and water damage when we tore up the one carpet in the house to start the remodeling process. We contacted our realtor who said that, because it was a foreclosure, the seller would do nothing. We had the floor and adjacent wall remediated, but we continued to find mold and water damage in every room of the house. We now know that, without exaggeration, there is mold in every single wall, ceiling, and floor of the house from the attic to the basement. It is severe and has likely been growing for decades. We hired an industrial hygienist to help us make a plan for remediation due to the severity and complexity of the problem. His testing confirmed that there are several strains of toxic mold present in the house. (Because our house is unfit for habitation, we searched in vain for an apartment within an hour's drive of Springfield. The housing market is so tight, there was nothing available. So we eventually bought the camper as a last resort.) Due to the presence of vermiculite in the attic (a type of insulation used in the 1950's when the house was built which often contains asbestos, which is highly toxic), he helped us create a plan to move the vermiculite away from the outer walls so the mold could be addressed safely. We had received a quote of $18 - 20,000 to have the vermiculite addressed professionally, which was not in our budget. In Vermont, homeowners are allowed by law to move or remove asbestos as long as certain safety precautions are followed. So we bought all the necessary equipment for the project. Tim built a decontamination chamber in the house and spent over 80 hours in the attic wearing a full face respirator and tyvec suit to move the vermiculite two feet away from the outer edges of the walls. Once he completed this work, we were ready to start the mold remediation process. The first step was to remove the affected areas of walls and flooring. We had hired a contractor to help us with the remodeling, but ended up needing him to do demolition. However, he complicated matters greatly with his mistakes. Even though he was instructed not to touch certain parts of the ceiling due to the presence of vermiculite in the attic, and was given a written copy of the remediation and abatement plan, he removed parts of the ceiling that caused vermiculite to spill throughout the living space of the house. He also performed illegal asbestos abatement by using his shop vac and a broom and dust pan to ""clean up"" his mess, thereby making the problem worse by spreading the microscopic fibers further. The new estimate for asbestos abatement is $38,000, which has to be completed before mold remediation could begin. Our most recent estimate for professional mold remediation is $21,000. We simply don't have that kind of money. We had spent all the money we had on replacement windows, kitchen cabinets, appliances, a garage door, and flooring - all of which is non-returnable. Our homeowner's insurance denied any mold coverage as it was ""pre-existing"" and are currently looking into the vermiculite spill. We tried for weeks to find a lawyer without luck. Then we found a national consulting group, who specializes in these types of situations. After vetting them out we hired them. They collected and compiled the evidence for our case, and wrote a case summary report. (We have 4 physical binders plus a digital copy of our case). Their process included conducting environmental testing as well as medical testing. They found multiple strains of toxic mold present in the house, as well as high levels of harmful bacteria that occurs in water damaged homes. The medical tests revealed that toxins are present in our bodies that directly correlate to the mold in the house. (We are all under doctor's care for mold toxicity and have spent several thousand dollars for medical bills. Tim's health was the most affected, and he is currently undergoing imaging tests to determine the extent of the damage to his lungs in particular.) Once our case was built, we began the search with our consultant's help for a Vermont attorney who has complex litigation experience and a willingness to take our case on a contingency fee basis. I have personally contacted dozens and dozens of lawyers. Some names I was given by the Vermont Bar Association attorney referral line. I also reached out to The Vermont Association for Justice and the president did a query asking all of her contacts if they would take the case, and she received no interest. I also called many of the lawyers listed on their website. Some lawyers were recommended by word of mouth. I continue to hear over and over from the attorneys I speak to that we have clearly been wronged, our case is strong with multiple liable parties, but that either 1) they don't have time to take our case, or 2) they will take our case if we pay a retainer and an hourly fee. (We are now living paycheck to paycheck and have no savings for a retainer.) We have come to understand that, because we bought our house for $109,900, that this, plus the money we have spent related to this situation, currently adds up to about $200, 000, which isn't much in the eyes of a successful lawyer. Basically, the bottom line is that it's not ""a slam dunk"" that the attorney will make a lot of money off of us. While I understand that $200,000 is not a lot of money to many people, it was everything to us, and we now have nothing left. Making matters worse, all of our belongings, aside from some clothes and personal care items, were originally being stored in the basement of the house while we were working on remodeling. Once we found the mold and understood the severity of the problem, we took our industrial hygienist's advice and put everything into two 20 foot storage containers on the property. It is all contaminated with mold. We have used mold bombs in the storage containers, and while they helped to decrease the mold spores, it continues to grow back. We have learned that we will need to dispose of and replace all of our ""soft"" belongings that are not washable and treatable, such as mattresses, couch and recliner, stuffed toys, etc. We are in disbelief and heartbroken that we have, thus far, been unable to find an attorney to help us. We were assured in the beginning by our consultant that finding a lawyer would be the easiest part of the process and that the majority of their cases are take on a contingency fee basis. Why, then, is no one willing to help us? We are now in the process of brainstorming and exploring all possible options of moving forward, so that our family has a safe place to live. Ideally an attorney will agree to help us and we will settle outside of court, as we have been told is the probable outcome of our case. All we want is our money back so we can start over in a normal, safe, healthy home. But time is running short. Winter will be here before we know it. We cannot declare bankruptcy - we intend to pay our family members back the money they loaned us. But we cannot continue to pay the mortgage, taxes, and insurance and afford to rent an apartment on top of that. We could potentially sell the house, as it is, at a loss. But we would rather not if we don't have to. We are hoping to raise money here to put toward the asbestos abatement and mold remediation so that we can sell the house for what we bought it for and get our family members' money back to repay them. If our insurance company decides to cover any of the damages, we would use money raised here toward an apartment or to replace essential items (mattresses, etc.) Any donation amount is welcome and would be greatly appreciated. Even a small donation would help tremendously by restoring my faith in humanity. I have been emotionally broken by this experience. My greatest hesitancy about sharing our story publicly and asking for help was not just my pride (although of course that played a big part.) It was the fact that I would be making myself much more vulnerable to being hurt again. What if nobody cared enough to help? I spoke to a realtor about our situation today and she reminded me that there are indeed good people in the world, and that we deserve help. She recommended I set up a Go Fund Me account. Her big heart impacted me, and so I am trying her idea. If you cannot donate, I ask you to please say a prayer for our family's healing and safety, and that we find a solution to this mess. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

Pinky Tam Support Fund,"$33,875 CAD raised of $50,000 goal","For those of you who may not know, our mother was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer recently. This grave and unexpected news hit our family and loved ones the week of March 16. She had been experiencing pain and numbness in her left arm over the past few months that we originally thought was only muscle related, but when these symptoms continued she decided to see a specialist who took some X-rays. These X-rays revealed to us that that it was in fact not muscle related but showed a mass that was causing permanent damage to discs in her vertebrae. We were also told that there was a high probability that the mass could be cancerous.

After going through subsequent scanning and testing, it was confirmed that our mother is suffering from metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung. With the scans revealing that it had metastasized in 4 parts of her body, including the tumour damaging her vertebrae, it was confirmed: our mother had stage 4 lung cancer. While we were shocked and despairing over the news, we were thankful to hear that there is a targeted drug therapy treatment that has proven successful in other cases similar to our mother’s.

While digesting this news, our family also had to make the quick decision for our mother to undergo a complex surgery as time was of the essence in avoiding further, irreparable damage to her vertebrae. Our mother had surgery on March 26, and while the surgery itself went as planned, the pre-surgery embolization process (emboli introduced into the blood stream to decrease blood loss during surgery) caused an extremely rare event. We learned the day after surgery that our mother had also suffered a minor stroke caused by some of these emboli leaking into her brain capillaries, causing permanent damage. Since surgery she has been regaining her cognitive functions which were highly impacted, such as coordination and memory.

Only limited healthcare in Hong Kong is covered by the government, meaning the only way to get our mother care and treatment in a timely manner is to pay for private healthcare. Unfortunately, the targeted cancer treatment is also not subsidized. While we are grateful beyond words that there is a targeted drug that has proven successful at slowing the cancer growth, it comes with a cost that our family was not quite prepared for. The cost of this daily drug and radiation therapy are immense. This is why we are asking for your help.

If you know our mother, you would know that she is an incredibly selfless person who would never dream of asking anyone for help - especially during a time when hundreds of thousands are suffering from a pandemic both physically and financially. If you do decide to participate, we thank you deeply from the bottom of our hearts and ask that you only contribute what you can. Every little bit counts and we appreciate all the time and effort you have already put into our family. And even if you are unable to contribute financially, we continue to thank you for your emotional support throughout this journey.

Thank you for taking the time to read our story and for all or those who have already provided an overwhelming amount of support in love, hope and prayers. They have been and continue to be invaluable acts of kindness to our family.

Howard and Tim Need Your Help,"$28,525 raised","Since meeting in an El Paso, Texas bar in the mid-1960s, partners Howard Deakyne and Tim Fuller have been working toward a better world both for individuals and our nation. Together they built innovative communities of caring in California, Colorado, Missouri, the District of Columbia, and their home state, Texas. Those who have been fortunate enough to meet Howard and Tim share the conviction that these are two men possessed of an extraordinary sense of civic responsibility, compassion, and depth of character.


Howard and Tim’s life is one of legend. In California, they befriended famous poets of the Beat generation; in Boulder, Colorado, they opened a bookstore where Tim later won political office and worked to pass the first local ordinance in the United States which outlawed discrimination against gays and lesbians; in rural Missouri, Howard and Tim bred award-winning goats; in Washington, they ran progressive campaigns to end hunger and homelessness, and worked to revitalize the Gray Panthers, building coalitions to fight for universal health care and campaign finance reform; Howard taught life-changing high school courses in English and film; the couple even opened the mind of a staunch conservative drill sergeant who went on to serve as best man at their wedding. There are many such stories and few know them all, but one need only look to the diversity of those who surround Howard and Tim to appreciate their altruism, which has connected people of different ages, genders, orientations, and social backgrounds.


This storied life, however, has taken a somber turn. In November 2016, Howard was diagnosed with Stage IIIb lung cancer. For most of 2017, he underwent standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The results were initially encouraging – the cancer showed no signs of progression. Sadly, right before Thanksgiving 2017, a hospitalization for a severe headache revealed that the cancer had metastasized to his brain. Twelve additional full-brain radiotherapy treatments ensued at a great physical and psychological cost. So intense were the side effects of the treatments that Howard began to question his ability to continue fighting the disease.


Hope has come in the form of a cutting-edge immunotherapy drug called Tagrisso. Clinical trials suggest that continued use of the medication will curtail the cancer’s progression and thus extend Howard’s life. It is now an essential component of the current care plan. Both he and his oncologist are very optimistic. Unfortunately, Tagrisso’s price is a prohibitive $13,000 monthly. Combined with other necessary expenses - which include, but are not limited to: supplemental medication, lab work, doctor visits, palliative and domestic assistance, insurance premiums, and transportation – the cumulative out-of-pocket total swells to roughly $17,800 monthly.
 

Refusing to be victim of this exorbitant cost, Tim has successfully secured a grant that will cover the Tagrisso in full. Factoring in support from Medicare and Mutual of Omaha, his and Howard’s financial obligations now stand at $4,800 a month ($57,600 annually).  The goal of this campaign is to raise the foregoing sum so that the beneficiaries can focus on each other, rather than the dollars and cents required to extend their time together.


Having given of themselves tirelessly for their entire lives, neither Howard nor Tim have accumulated vast riches in their time. They instead pursued a life of shared simplicity and as a result, now lack sufficient funds to cover all of their expenses without assistance. Friends and family have already stepped in to the best of their ability, but more help is needed. This fundraiser is an opportunity to make a contribution to the wellbeing of men who have dedicated themselves to enriching the lives of others. A donation of any amount is greatly appreciated.

A Family in Need of a Home,"$14,828 raised of $25,000 goal","My name is James Geikie. I'm 37, a stepdad, a musician and a teacher. Last September, my fiance and I purchased a home to fix up for ourselves and her kids. We trusted that the house was only in need of reasonable repairs. So we waived an inspection, and bought it ""as is"". That was easily one of the biggest mistakes of my life. We had to jump through endless hurdles and finally paid $200,000. That was as much as we could afford, and the seller wouldn't drop the price. All of our savings went into closing costs and paying off previous credit debts to obtain the loan.

Between termite damage, years of neglect due to rampant drug addiction, and 100 years of bad cover-up repair jobs, we have our hands full. The home needs a nearly full electrical overhaul, restructuring, reinsulating, basically it needs to be rebuilt completely from the inside out, and we don't have the means to do so. We have been putting our all into it, and have nearly nothing to show for it.

Help Margit with Stage 3 Melanoma and MS,"$10,473 AUD raised of $5,000 goal","It's difficult to ever imagine having to create a fundraiser to help a family member fight cancer. Especially for a Mother that has given so much in her life and asked so little in return.

Last year my mother was diagnosed with Stage 3 Malignant Melanoma after a biopsy of a lump on her neck that had been causing her pain. The days and weeks following the announcement were some of the hardest we've endured as a family. We were soon plunged into the world of cancer information. We received multiple literatures from our Australian doctors on what this diagnosis means, the possible treatments and all their side effects to go with it. 

Immunotherapy is one of those treatments that has been widely used with much greater success than chemotherapy treatments. It works by stimulating the Immune System of the body to assist in fighting off cancer cells - often with much less side effects than chemotherapy as well.

Unfortunately in my mother's case, its more complicated because she also suffers from Multiple Sclerosis (MS), an illness found on the brain that affects the Immune System of the body.

This means that if she was to receive immunotherapy, doctors advised there is a high chance that her MS could flare up which can lead to paralysis or even be fatal.

Having met with several Oncologists since the initial diagnosis, their consensus was to not offer a full blown immunotherapy treatment to reduce the risk of flaring up her MS. They would only administer one type of drug that may help control the cancer. We asked what would happen if it didn't work, to which they responded that they would be looking at palliative care.



I can imagine news like that can break a persons will and send them in a downward spiral. But not my mum, she's a fighter - and more stubborn than you can imagine.

She continued to research her situation and through networking with other cancer patients, she was able to come into contact with Dr. Michael Weber, a German doctor who specialises in stem cell, nano particle and photodynamic therapy treatments for cancer (not available through the Australian public healthcare system)

Having explained her situation and our financial position to him, Dr. Michael Weber advised that his treatments may help without a risk of flaring up her MS and also agreed to carry out the treatment free of cost.
We would only need to cover the cost of the medication itself which is $5000. A small price to pay for a glimmer of hope.

His medical clinic is overseas so we would need to cover the costs of flying over there as well as paying for food and accommodation for the two week stay.

I know many of you have already donated towards bushfire appeals to help fight these terrible bushfires that are ravaging our beautiful nation, so we ask that you only donate what you are able to.

If you were to give a donation, we would use the money for the following:
- Medicinal costs for the cancer treatment
- Airfare costs to get to the clinic
- Accommodation near the clinic
- Food

I've set the goal at $5,000 to ensure we cover the cost of the medication but any additional funding will help tremendously towards the plane tickets, food and other costs associated with her illness.


Thank you for taking the time to read my mum's story and we wish you and your family good health and happiness.

Michele’s Journey....... You + Me = Hope,"£36,738 raised of £100,000 goal","We are raising money for our beautiful friend Michele and her brave son Luke-Keston. In September 2016, Michele was diagnosed with Triple Negative Breast Cancer. She had a mastectomy, followed by another four surgeries, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Michele means the world to us, she is not just our friend, she is our family.

However, on 25 March 2019 Michele was given the devastating news that the cancer had not only returned but has also metastasised to her bones and lymph nodes. This news has floored us all, we are all in utter shock and heartbroken. Michele has been told that she cannot be cured but can only be offered treatment to prolong her life. Despite this, Michele in her usual style is handling this news with such dignity, strength and determination.

For those who know Michele, whilst enduring her breast cancer treatment in 2017, she worked endlessly to raise funds for The Empress Breast Care Unit at the Darent Valley Hospital. Not only did her son shave her hair off for the unit, she ran the Bath Half Marathon whilst on chemotherapy and got a team together to do the London to Brighton walk (100k) without sleep. Currently her prognosis is very poor, so we are fighting this and hoping to raise as much money as we can to give her as many options as possible for alternative treatments.

Michele is desperately seeking as many options as possible as this shattering news has turned her whole world upside down. Michele and Luke have such a strong bond between them. Luke is the kindest, most thoughtful, caring, beautiful soul which is a massive reflection on how Michele has brought him up. Luke has had to deal with several traumatic events throughout his short life, not only Michele’s first breast cancer diagnosis but also having to deal with the fact his Dad was injured in Afghanistan losing his leg and sight in his right eye, so now to be told that Michele’s advanced breast cancer is incurable is devastating for anyone let alone a 13 year old boy.

Michele is looking at alternative treatments but the treatment is expensive. To give you an idea, the immunotherapy she needs will cost her £5,000 a month for the rest of her life. An alternative cancer centre will cost £35,000 for a 3-week treatment plan which she may need several times. All of these options come at such a huge cost and this is where we need your help.

Michele is overwhelmed by the lovely messages offering her help and support, there are so many people behind her, so let’s all get together now for our beautiful friend and her brave son Luke-Keston.

Lots of Love

The disease attacks the special fibers found only in the muscle of the head and jaw, and this extremely painful condition inflames muscles, preventing your dog from opening his or her mouth to eat, chew or play with toys.

Head and Neck Cancer Survivor Bruce,"$3,925 raised of $4,866 goal","Update: A very troubling three-month cancer scare has just ended; pain in my right jaw right in the path of the radiation that burned my tongue and throat keeps me from wanting to eat. It was a nervous trip down to Dana-Farber in Boston and a glorious ride back after my doc said it's NOT CANCER and it's like having a sprained ankle in my jaw. Apparently the pain's caused by a custom-made dental appliance my dentist made for me to even out my bite so I can chew and help me gain back some of the 70 pounds I lost when I was sick. The price for this fix is stunning, but it had to be done, and I'm trying to find a way to pay for it.

A few weeks ago my oncologist told me I'm still in remission. Happy day. So I'm trying to be mindful and appreciate every moment. Thank you all so much.

My Cancer: I was told I had ""untreatable"" Stage 4 metastatic head and neck cancer in 2008 and was successfully treated at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute with radical head and neck dissection surgery, high-intensity focused radiation and the NIH's first human trial of the experimental nanotechnology-produced chemotherapy drug Abraxane.

Since I had nothing to lose, I agreed to participate in the experimental drug trial on the chance that someone after me might benefit. Wouldn't you? It worked, but took a heavy toll on my body. The punch line is that I'm presently gratefully in remission, thank God (I really do.) My cancer survival is one thing, but my cancer treatment survival has been a much, much greater challenge.

Recovery has been difficult as I've been struggling to take better care of myself by myself. I lost 70 pounds that I have not been able to restore. And a year ago, I fell down a flight of stairs breaking my back.

Today I'm trying to be my own healer; I successfully kicked opioids two months ago. Walking two miles every other day, being a smart food shopper, trying to eat better and trying to make myself think positive thoughts. I want to start taking yoga classes. Hard to believe, huh? I've always been a diagnosis, drug and knife kind of guy. I've done all that; now I'm seeking inner healing.

Money's so tight...well, you get it. My social security check can't cover my monthly expenses. I need to get stabilized and do the things I need to do to restore myself. It's been so hard for me to ask for help and say ""yes"" to offers from family and good friends. My wonderful siblings are graciously helping me an many, many ways. Here's the hard part: asking for help getting back on my feet. It'll be even harder to accept it, but I'm managing to keep my dignity. So I'm asking for help. Anonymous works.

Legal Expenses For The Welfare of Persephone,"$5,760 raised","Hello, I don't know about you but for us, asking for help is extremely hard. And sharing our ""dirty laundry""  is even harder. Nonetheless, we are forced to plead for your help in order to protect our granddaughter Persephone and to provide the best future that we can for her.  
The reason for our fundraiser is to obtain the legal help we need in order to get custody of our 3-year-old granddaughter, Persephone (Perry). Our daughter, Persephone's mother, is an addict who has moved on to selling drugs and selling pornographic videos of herself to strangers in order to fund her habit.  We'd like to protect our granddaughter from that type of environment. We have already removed Perry from her mother temporarily but in order to get legal custody, we will need to obtain a lawyer.  The retainer fee for the lawyer is $10,000.00 and we need your help.

Become a Child's Miracle,"£8,121 raised","Hello. Thank you for taking the time to visit my GoFundMe page.

I’ve set up this page to raise funds for a cause that’s very close to my heart. El Demerdash Paediatric Hospital in Cairo treats children across Egypt with very serious and life threatening conditions. It is solely reliant on donations and recently have been in desperate need for funds. Walking through the wards and witnessing so many heart wrenching cases, it’s painfully clear that their suffering is unnecessarily worsened, simply because their families cannot afford treatment.



But I’ll start with some background first. My name is Timmy, I’m a doctor working in the UK and was recently diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). GBS is a rapid-onset muscle paralysis caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system – the nerves connecting signals from the brain and spine to the body.
My road to recovery was long, tough and draining, but it worked as I am blessed enough to have been able to afford treatment. And here I am today, almost back to full health. But like I said, I was extremely lucky. There are hundreds of children at El Demerdash hospital who face what I have faced, and a lot worse, without any hope for a better future. 



Here are just a few examples demonstrating how dire some of these kid’s situations are:

Ali is nine years old arriving at Demardash with his family having suddenly experienced a rising paralysis that rendered him and his family completely at the mercy of El Demerdash. He was diagnosed with GBS and needed immunoglobulins for treatment. 

Immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment is the best therapy for numerous autoimmune disorders, including GBS. It’s what I was treated with, and, at its best can lead to a full recovery. It significantly decreases the severe damage caused by these diseases, which can include total paralysis including that of the face, lungs and lead to death. These drugs can save lives in more ways than one.  Unfortunately, IVIg is expensive, needed in liberal quantities and exported from abroad, making it extremely difficult for El Demerdash to afford.



To put it into context:  A child needing IVIg will normally need to take 1 g of the drug for every 1 kg of his/her body weight. 1 g of IVIg costs the hospital 1,000 EGP (50 sterling pounds). In Ali’s case he needs 28 g per day, what would sum up to a total of 140,000 EGP (£7,000) after five days of treatment, or remain paralysed.

Even just £5-10 equates to 100-250 EGP, which is the price of one CREON box of tablets (replacement enzymes) and that alone will drastically improve the quality of life of a child suffering from cystic fibrosis (currently very high in demand in El Demerdash but not attainable without our help).

Another adorable three year old girl brought in by her mother for drowsiness was later diagnosed with viral encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and again needed IVIg amongst other drugs. She needed 1 g for every cute 14 kg that she weighs and for two days of treatment, equalling a total of 30,000 EGP.

It is safe to say that it is an insurmountable amount of money for these children’s families who come from as far as Aswan, a 10 hour drive, in hopes of treating their children despite their poor background. So this is why I’ve set up this page. If we can raise enough, we can make an actual, real difference to these children’s lives. We will give them a future they never thought they could have. We will be giving their parents the chance to see their children grow. The right treatment can work wonders for these diseases: just look at me, I’m a case in point. And I refuse to be the only lucky one.



And so I want to do everything that I can do to help, and I’m setting us some goals: for every 20,000 EGP (£1,000) raised, I will be taking requests for fundraising challenges. So please help give these children and their families their lives back, and I promise to give you some laughs out of it along the way too.



I am in close contact with Dr and Professor Mona Ganzoury.  She is working in El Demerdash and is my key contact who is allocating funds for treatment to the children in most need. Dr Mona keeps reminding me that these families and children truly have nothing to rely on but us and God. I urge you to join us and trust that with these funds we will all Become a Child's Miracle.

Richards Zytiga(CANCER) Medication,"$4,950 raised of $4,950 goal","Those of you who know us know that Richard Tillis is the hardest working 75 year old you've ever known.  He is a retired City/County Manager and  a retired  licensed Contractor and Home Inspector.  He obtained his BA when he was 54 and his masters in business two years later.    He has always been generous with his many talents and willing to help anyone in need.  His business goals was to always give a fair price for good work. 
Richard was diagnosed with Prostate cancer in 2010 and had it removed in 2011.  He has been on Lupron since then.   Recently his PSA  has increased again and his doctor has prescribed a chemo drug called Zytiga. 
Zytiga is a tier 5 drug; what this means is we have  to meet a co-payment of $4,950.00  to bridge the Medicare  ""gap"" to get to the catastrope stage where the drug will only be $400.00 a month.   He was suppose to start taking the meds in December but because the co-pay is so high and the cop-pay starts over January 1st, we have decided to wait until the first of the year to start meds.  His PSA as of 12/21/16, is 0.16.  We will be opening a special account to deposit any and all donations made for the Zytiga.

Adoption Fund for Brenden and E.,"$6,495 raised of $13,000 goal","Ten years ago there was a meth explosion that changed the lives of two little boys forever.  Brenden, three at the time, and Caleb, two days old, came to live with Connie and Cecil Tollett because their biological parents chose drugs over them.  The dad (Connie's brother) went to prison and the mom got probation.  Two and a half years later, those parents allowed Connie and Cecil to adopt Caleb, but not Brenden.  Brenden was allowed to go back to live with his mother, who had remarried and soon gave birth to E, Brenden and Caleb's sister. 
Fast forward a few years and the dad is out of prison and the mom is living with her abusive husband.  The drug use emerges once again.  Connie and Cecil step in quickly and are approved to be foster parents.  Brenden is allowed to come live with them while E. is sent to another foster home.
The parental rights have been severed and the issue of adoption is in the air for both Brenden and E. E's foster mom is also wanting to adopt her. Connie and Cecil are the only ones fighting to adopt Brenden.
Unfortunately, it has not been an easy fight.  Despite severing ties with her brother, his sins are still being held against her, threatening Brenden's adoption.  Brenden wants to be  adopted by Connie and Cecil.  He wants to live with his brother, Caleb, and he wants their sister with them.
The only stability Brenden has ever had has been when he is with his aunt and uncle.  He's been through extensive therapy to deal with his abandonment by his parents and is finally in a place where he is progressing in a healthy manner.
Connie and Cecil have already spent over $5000 on this fight, but an expected property sale fell through, leaving them with no financial way to continue this fight.  This is where you come in.  It's going to take at least $10,000 more to continue the fight for Brenden and E.'s adoption.  Connie and Cecil need help to keep a family together.  The price is so high because Connie's attorney has to put on a case showing that she is a good, upstanding citizen, a good mother, and would continue to sever all ties with the biological parents.  A private home study has to be done to show that the home is stable and adequately equipped for the extra two children.
Connie has a PhD and teaches at a local university while Cecil has a small independant business that he runs. They are upstanding citizens who have respected the law, they have two adult children that are successful in their fields.  They want to provide the same opportunities to Brenden, Caleb, and E. 
They would be so thankful for any help you can offer.

Thank you so much for reading their story.

Donate to Help Jadyn and Haven Get a Car,"$140 raised of $5,000 goal","Hi everyone! My name is Jadyn Yost, and I am going to be writing this on behalf of myself and my twin sister, Haven Yost. When I was talking to someone about our situation, they encouraged me to try something like this. First, I would like to give you a bit of background/insight into our lives leading up to this point, because I think it is important when trying to understand the situation. I have grown up with parents who struggled consistently with drug addiction, which has led to so much uncertainty, unstable living conditions, and financial burdens. These last two years have been especially difficult, as my parents' fight with drug addiction got increasingly hard and recently landed them in jail, unfortunately. This situation has left my sister and I with very little support, leaving us to navigate many important financial circumstances alone. We both work, however, we are both financially responsible for other expenses including paying for our phone bill, gas, necessities, etc. In addition to this, we do as much as we can for our two baby siblings, who are 4 and 9 years old. While trying to work to afford our most important things, we also are navigating our senior year of high school and the beginning of college. We currently drive a 1999 Honda Civic that has been breaking down frequently and becoming a big obstacle in our lives. Due to the age of the vehicle and the condition it is in, it is starting to become very difficult to get our car to and from places like work and school. Every time we go to get something fixed on our car, shortly after a new issue follows in what feels like a never-ending cycle of car problems. Our car does not have a gas gauge and the gas and oil tanks both leak. We have also found issues with the belt and brakes, which still need to be fixed. In addition to this, our heat and air conditioning goes in and out frequently, which presents its own set of issues. Overall, the price of keeping up with our car is proving to be expensive and not worth it at this point. That is why I am here, asking for help. My sister and I really need to get a different vehicle that would help us get to and from work and school without so many issues. However, our family situation has left us with little support when trying to pay for a car. We are both willing, and happy to, look into financing a car, however, that requires a down payment and due to the difficulty, we have faced in the last couple of months, we haven't been able to save up much money. We have worked really hard to maintain our academics amid the life-altering circumstances that were presented to us this year with our family issues. We were both accepted and will be attending the University of Virginia in the fall of 2024 and hope to have a vehicle that can support us driving back home to visit family and help us navigate Charlottesville without issues. Anything at all helps, and we are beyond appreciative of anyone who even considered reading/looking into this GoFundMe. Your support means everything to us, and I am so grateful for everyone who has helped us in any way throughout this journey. Thank you. (: If you could share this fundraiser with others we would really appreciate it!

Fire Family trip of a lifetime,"$10,625 raised of $10,000 goal","The Pullman Firefighters have pledged to send the Gollnick Family of 5 on a trip of a lifetime in April 2017.  We are asking for your help in making this a truly memorable trip.  Our goal is $10,000 that will be used to pay for all expenses for the family to travel, stay, and play at a destination chosen by the family.  

Please read the update from Meg Gollnick that she posted on October 18th, 2016.  
""It's been awhile since I have posted anything here and I guess I am feeling a little overwhelmed by the madness of scheduling doctor appointments, one after the other but my main struggle is with acceptance. The reality is, I have Stage IV Metastatic Breast Cancer. This means it has metastasized to my bone and that there are cancer cells circulating through my blood. I think about this and still can't believe it myself. You can google the prognosis on this stage and know that it is not good. So what do we do now? Well, right now my life is filled with medications, treatments, appointments and research. I have been researching the most effective treatment plans and feel like we can move forward with a firm plan. Attack the cancer from three different directions: 1. Anti-estrogen medication since this cancer grows faster with estrogen in your body. Hopefully, no estrogen equals no growth but that's not good enough, attack #2. Ibrance is a second med, this medication blocks a different pathway than the anti-estrogen drug. This is important because eventually cancer cells figure out a way to multiply and spread even without the presence of estrogen. This drug is supposed to give you double the time to progression. It's a newer drug that has only been out since 2014. So if prognosis is three years, this may give me six years. This drug comes with a hefty price, $11,000/month for 21 pills. And no, that is not a typo! Luckily, our insurance covers every penny, and don't get me started with the politics of big Pharma but at this point, I have no choice. Attack #3. Targeted radiation. They will use radiation to target the two spots on my ribs to kill most of the cancer cells. This can also help relieve some pain as well. This is kind of the standard treatment and may also be ongoing if I have other spots that arise. Today, I start the targeted radiation up in Spokane. I have done this rodeo before so I'm not too stressed about this procedure. It takes about 30 minutes and is not painful. But here is what's painful, watching my husband struggle through acceptance, my family worry and wonder WHY? My own big questions to God on the why and how this will all turn out. And my boys... right now, I can't even talk about it or in this case, write about it at this point. Way too raw and emotional. If you know me, you know my boys are my entire world. It's all so so hard but my FAITH is rock solid and I am relying on that to get us all through this part of our lives. For now, will you all pray for us and hold us in your hearts? And once again, be mindful of what you say to your own children so that our boys can learn what is to come in their own time and way. God bless you all.....""

While other fundraisers are working to help the Gollnick family with bills and childcare, we want to create a memory that will last for a lifetime.  

Thank you for taking the time to help a member of the Pullman Firefighter Family.

Support Tem Tarriktar,"$29,442 raised of $40,000 goal","This is written by Tem's wife, Kate.

As some of you know, Tem Tarriktar has thyroid cancer with metastases. We didn’t notice anything until last summer, but apparently the tumor is aggressive and has already gone into some bones. The thyroid oncologist he’s seeing says Tem is very ill and that we need to be aggressive in his treatment. He believes the cancer is being fueled by a rare genetic fusion and is hopeful that a genetically targeted medication he has researched, if it works as expected, could shrink the main tumor, as well as the metastases, from 50 to 75% relatively quickly. This doctor has ordered it and we’re waiting to see if Blue Shield will cover it, as it’s very expensive (about $20K a month).


Unfortunately, the drug is not a cure, and the cancer will likely eventually outsmart the drug effects. The oncologist has no idea when that can happen, but we’ve been hearing about people who have lived three years on this drug. The oncologist thinks there are a few other drugs that might be used if the main ones stop working. So, we are trying to find ways to strengthen Tem while he takes this drug and experiences its side effects, which should not be as severe as typical chemo drugs, especially since we have a team of alternative health care people (not covered by insurance) that will help Tem weather the storm.


Meanwhile, Tem is suffering with constant mucous formation in his throat from the irritation of the main tumor. It keeps him from sleeping and breathing easily. He may get about four hours a night, with drugs to help him get beyond the distress of the mucous. This process has become more difficult since the emergency intubation and tracheostomy he underwent two weeks ago, because his breathing tube was being pressed on by the growth of the tumor.

Tem has had seven surgeries and procedures in the last eight months, including thyroid surgery that  had a limited benefit — the tumor had infiltrated structures in his throat; a procedure to prop up the vocal cord that had already been paralyzed by the tumor; a gastric tube placed in his stomach because he couldn’t eat enough without aspirating into his lungs; and an emergency tracheostomy (which may be reversible if the drug can shrink the tumor). His quality of life, as you can imagine, is very poor. He is underweight and very weak.


Our business, The Mountain Astrologer Magazine, is being run by our small group of employees, with a little help from Tem when he’s able. The employees have been amazing in their ability to adapt to Tem’s situation. At this point, the magazine is going to press on time, and the high quality of the publication has been maintained. Tem started this magazine 30 years ago from a little rag costing 50 cents, and it is now an international publication.


So far, we’re working to find Tem some skilled nursing assistance and a Transitions group that can oversee symptom management. If insurance doesn’t approve, this will be an added expense. If the drug is not approved and the manufacturer turns us down, we would need to finance the drug ourselves at $20K per month. We’re hoping for the best, and that it will happen soon. Time is of the essence. We must also hire in-home help, since I cannot take care of Tem's needs by myself. An out-of-town friend has been here for a month, and without him, I would have been floundering, as I have my own health issues that take time to address each day.


Tem has been a warrior for the last few years, tenaciously caring for me when I was close to death. He tirelessly researched treatments and encouraged me to forge ahead and try new approaches. And all this was done while continuing to maintain the magazine, and care for himself and our home. Many people came forward to support me both financially and donating their time, and we will always be grateful for everyone who helped us. It is now Tem’s turn to need your help. He is a kind, deep, intelligent, even-tempered, and vital man, and he is open emotionally and spiritually.
 


 
We’re having a weekly virtual healing circle on Monday nights at 7:00 p.m. PDT, with a focus on this drug being available and actually helping to improve Tem's condition. He needs a great deal of support and help now from friends and TMA readers who value the contribution he's made to his field. Tem sends his love to friends, family, and the astrological community. Thank you for any support you're able to give.

Before I was diagnosed with POTS, I was doing ok in life, I was working, living by myself and having an ok life, just me and my 2 cats.

We need help and can't do this on our own.   As you know we have been battling my health issues for almost 4 years now.  We have received several diagnosis' and plans of treatment, traveled to some of the top doctors and facilities in the country to get help but they have not been able to slow this down to date. In doing so we have maxed all our credit cards, emptied our checking and savings, and still continue to accumulate medical bills along with all our regular stuff.  We have also maxed out Diann's vacation days so any time missed for appointments or hospital stays has been unpaid. This is hard on our finances and is causing additional stress. Here is where we are now:   Financially :We have medical bills stacking up and even making payment plans has a huge strain on our budget.  Medicines are costing a lot too even with disability insurance. Physically: I have not been able to eat and hold down any significant amount of food for almost 6 or 7 months now. I have a 24/7 continuous feeding tube that causes pain when water, my meds, the formula, or pureed vegetables are going in.  I can't take in anything by mouth or my stomach port without vomiting. Everything goes to the jejunum. I have zero energy and feel sick all the time even with stomach meds. I am about 90 to 95 percent bed bound. Most movement is painful and causes vomiting. I only leave the house for doctor appointments these days.  I have to wear a mask when outside or near people because I am severely compromised in my immune system and with mast cell activation I can develop a sudden anaphalactic shock to something as simple as a person's perfume or a pollen. I am in severe pain from the top of my head to the toes on my feet ALL the time from the small fiber neuropathy.  My digestive system has failed. We are exhausted. We are tired of trying the new meds, diet changes, and all the side effects that come with each new med. We have been referred to hospice as the issues I have are not curable and continue to rapidly get worse. They are currently trying to determine if hospice or palliative care is more appropriate for where we are now. We are still deciding the best path. We are not giving up and are still trying to explore solutions for getting to better health. We need your support - whether it is through donating financial means, prayers, good thoughts, or just reaching out to say hi. Please know we are very grateful. We wouldn't ask for help unless absolutely needed. We are doing everything we can and it isn't enough.  We promise to pay it forward when we can.

Help with Connor’s medical expenses,"$6,500 raised of $15,000 goal","Connor left with family friends Thursday night to head out to Rapid for state wrestling in a great mood and looking forward to the weekend ahead. They stopped in Mitchell for the night to stay with family and the boys jumped into the hot tub. The boys were dunking their heads (like kids do) Connor was breathing in and out a few times before dunking his head he simply exerted his lungs and hyperventilated, passed out - he then went under the water and his friends were fast in acting and pulled his head up but it was just a bit late as he had already sucked so much water in. He was only under a few seconds but just enough. The boys courageous actions and getting help which wasn’t far from their side saved Connor a lot of damage if not his life. They were unclear as to what had originally happened, they thought a seizure, and when he came to in Mitchell he lost it and was upset and they decided then to sedate him.

He was then air lifted to sf where mom and dad met up with him. He started showing great progress right away. He was removed from the vent, doing well, eating and walking around. Everything seemed to be going great. Removed his ICU status. Then There was a bit of a set back with some pretty high temps the last couple of days to which everyone has been baffled over because he was doing so well so quickly. Many many tests, multiple scans ran with no answers. He is still battling the unknown as tests and scans are coming back clear.

Everyone that helped and was there and everyone who’s reached out and prayed we can’t thank you all enough.

Help with Patty's Medical Expenses,"$34,360 raised of $25,000 goal","Hi friends and family,

As many of you know, our mom has recently undergone a Myeloablative (high-intensity) Bone Marrow Transplant. You can visit her Caring Bridge site for more details and updates on her treatment here: https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/pattyhendricks

Many of you have reached out asking how you can help support our parents practically during this time. As you can imagine, the cost of an apartment rental, laundry, and daily living expenses in Palo Alto on top of their mortgage and bills, as well as all of the medical procedure costs and prescriptions, puts a huge strain on my parents financially. Medication costs have been shockingly high (for example, one medication that costs $2,000/week, another that is $5,000/month, amongst many others). There are new medications that are being prescribed constantly that she to combat all of the potentially life-threatening things that can happen during this transplant process and she is stalling on picking them up from the pharmacy while she spends her days on the phone with her insurance company, Stanford, and the actual pharmaceutical companies themselves trying to get part of the cost covered so they can afford to pick them up. They have been able to get some of these costs reduced through these calls but the time spent trying to negotiate these prices is time lost taking these incredibly important medications, and even with price reductions, the overall costs of everything that goes along with this procedure are very high. During an already difficult and stressful time, we do not want her to be spending the days she is meant to be resting and healing on the phone for hours making calls about her medication costs. It puts so much extra stress on an already stressful time.

Medical Expenses for Kerry Croswhite,"$59,570 raised of $50,000 goal","My sister Laurie Croswhite’s husband is fighting for his life from Covid. They are both teachers and the medical bills are extremely high. This money would go towards paying the deductibles/costs. This is his story she posted from caringbridge.

https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/kerrycroswhite

Kerry became sick with fever, aches, and chills the day after Father's Day--June 22nd.  He isolated in the bedroom and his family tried to care for him with tylenol, vitamin D and Vitamin C.  He went to his doctor to test for COVID.  That one came out negative.  Tues, June 30th he voiced that he knew it had moved into his chest and the cough was worsening.  The pulse ox was showing he was dipping into the 80's for his oxygen.  On July 3rd he was talked into going to Banner Desert. He agreed but was hesitant being so scared. They took him right in, put him on oxygen, and did a chest X-ray.  It revealed double pneumonia.  He was admitted.  He was retested positive for COVID.  He ended up moving onto a BiPap machine, which is a full mask to deliver the oxygen.  This created a lot of anxiety and panic.  They gave him anti anxiety meds.  On  July 7, he was moved to the ICU.  The early morning of July 8, his oxygen was dropping and they needed to move him to a ventilator.  He coded on them while they were doing it.  They were able to revive him and complete the ventilation process.  Kerry is a fighter.  We keep saying his swimming and bagpipe lungs will help him.  We ask that everyone keeps praying for him during this journey.  Thank you to everyone that is praying and supporting us.

Medical expenses for Mayo Clinic,"$2,280 raised of $35,000 goal","Hi, my name is Kelsey Ruiz. I am reaching out to all our friends and family for help in raising money for my brothers medical expenses. We recently were referred to Mayo Clinic due to his extensive medical struggles in the hopes of finding out what is causing everything he is battling. His physicians here have exhausted all their channels and see no other way but for us to see highly trained specialists through a renowned medical center. Just this year alone he was hospitalized twice for an aggressive staph infection that turned septic. His bone loss, kidney and liver complications have raised questions as to something more in depth and comprehensive causing his poor health. Kade is the type of person who won't ask for help even if he needs it, he will do what he can to help you. He loves all things video games, kingdom hearts, anime and disney pin trading related. He enjoys being outside whether it be doing yard work, going out on the rzr, hiking or going on walks. Our family would be greatly appreciative of any help you can give. Due to the Mayo Clinic being out of network and out of state the expenses will be high and require him and my parents to travel for treatment, my father to miss work and the need to cover daily living necessities.","Orem, UT"

Help With Medical Expenses + Health,"$1,725 raised of $2,000 goal","I fell ill with a ""mystery illness"" in September of 2016, and I abruptly stopped being able to hold down foods.  The condition would subside for a few days then worsen, eventually developing stabbing pain or dull persistent pain for hours, even days.  A few bites of food and even sips of water would take hours, cause intense pain, or come right back up several times within an hour (sometimes 8 hours later, in public).  I had no health insurance until January, and in February was sent to a specialist who ran multiple tests with inconclusive results, incurring high medical costs from copays, medications that did not work, and more testing in the ER and outpatient that brought more questions than answers.  Something would come up that we couldn't explain, or there would be a false alarm and I would feel better for a week or two, only to be hunched over in pain and 10 pounds less within a few days.  After months with a gastroenterologist he ordered an MRI and called me two days later, in June, with a ""controversial"" diagnosis.  My superior mesenteric artery is compressing the first portion of my small intestine, my duodenum, causing pain, intermittent partial or complete blockage, and a number of other health concerns associated with the compression and accompanying malnutrition.  This condition is known as , an uncommon and controversial diagnosis affecting a reported less than 600 people since its discovery.  After that I was sent to four different surgery departments, the fourth of which agreeing to treat me.  In the hospital over the weekend, I was told to gain weight, something that has been impossible since September, or the angle of my artery can lessen and further compress, or I can become extremely malnourished again within a few days.  I am currently 25 pounds less than I was in September (this is 20% of my small frame).  Surgery is very high risk and has a low success rate (less than 50 percent) and involves rerouting my intestine outside of this major artery that cannot be moved or spread open.  The next step of conservative treatment is hospital admission and getting a feeding tube inserted so I can directly put nutrients in, surpassing the intestine.  I was pretty shaken up from 5 days in the hospital last week and am still in pain from the nasogastric decompression tube that was in my nose and throat for 3 days.  I had an NPO (nothing by mouth) order so I dropped almost 10 pounds despite having intravenous nutrition.  I am waking up most mornings still in pain, and don't know what is to come yet.  I can eat very little and am scared for the day I need admission and require the tube, but that is our next course of action.  I have been told symptoms often don't improve after weight gain along with the low success rate of the surgery, so this illness is ""difficult.""  The surgeon I spoke to was very honest and said many people don't want to deal with this because  they have tried before and didn't succeed or there are way too many questions and controversies surrounding how it presents itself and often doesn't resolve.  I have accumulated many medical expenses already and will accumulate more with the follow up appointments especially upon admission to the hospital for the tube, which will be the third admission since June.  I fear the unknown because of other stories I have heard, and know this might be the beginning of my story.  I need my life back and want to be able to live like a healthy 19 year old.  I have already lost a year of my life and its quality due to this condition that I can finally put a name to.  I have always been hesitant to ask for help but am in need of support in way (even spiritual or prayerful if that is what you can offer).  It is an immensely stressful time and to have even an ounce of the burden shared is a huge deal since bills and copays for tests, specialists, and hospitals can often come six weeks (or later) after the fact and are always higher than expected, so I am always waiting for the unknown and falling behind.  I spend a lot of time on the phone with insurance and facilities getting things approved and getting referrals to the right offices, so this is sadly the only thing on my mind most days.  I carry the stress with me every day and my only hope, more that anything is to bring awareness and let at least another person know that this condition exists and so many are suffering in silence every day.  More research is needed and the medical system is very flawed, but in times like this if anyone can offer good thoughts or any kind of support to another, it is appreciated so immensely.  Any read of this story means so much and I more than anything just needed to get off of my chest how I am suffering from this every day but any kind thought lets me know I'm heard during this time and not alone.  Much love to everyone ❤️

I’m trying to raise funds to offset my moms medical bills and living expenses. My whole life my mom and i have been two peas in a pod and she’s single-handedly raised me into the young woman i am today. My mom is a Registered Nurse who has dedicated her life to helping people. She’s also single mom who has worked two jobs, or done ridiculous amounts of overtime in order to keep us afloat and to make sure we always have what we need. My mom is genuinely my hero and those who have met her can testify to what an amazing, funny, and kind woman she is. Unfortunately about 3 1/2 months ago she fell extremely ill and has been hospitalized since October 11th. She has been in and out of the Intensive Care Unit and suffered from seizures that have damaged her speech, memory, and motor skills. She’s also been bedridden and currently cannot speak due to a tracheotomy. She most likely will be in the hospital or a rehabilitation center for more months to come. Since she’s been hospitalized I have had to pay the bills (car payment, phone, heating, water, ect.), take care of my house and pets, along with continuing in high school. I’ve done all of this while working a part time job since i’m still in high school and i could really use some help. Not only will the proceeds help me pay the bills they will also offset my moms medical expenses for her extended hospitalization.

But we never have had to get help and now that is and issue. My heath insurance has a high deductible with a 12k max out of pocket. The last three years we have maxed it out and to make matters worse a change in carriers caused some of my medical providers to be out of network or not supported. I have become depressed, and my wife and I had to use credit cards to pay bills. I currently have a lot of money on high interest credit cards and loans. This year’s medical bills are not going to get paid and I am at risk to lose my job and our home. I need to release the stress and as much as I do not want to; I need help. Currently we have 9k of medical expenses in collections. I have 22k in a high interest loan and several credit cards maxed out.

Brooke’s Medical Expenses High Risk Pregnancy,$375 raised,"Hi Friends!
I really was hoping to avoid this but it seems I have no choice!
As many of you know, I’m in my last pregnancy. I’m high risk and need surgery ASAP, but they’re waiting until I deliver for the safety of the baby. Because I’m high risk I have to deliver at UC Davis in Sacramento… this is 2.5 hours away on a good weather day with no traffic. I have multiple appointments coming up as well as an extended hospital stay in my future.

At this point I will be happy if I can make it 36 weeks, but I’ve been told by my high risk specialist we should be happy if I make it to 34 weeks: that would be March 8th. I went into preterm labor last weekend and was told if it happens again, or if my injury gets any more serious at all, I will be hospitalized until my delivery and after. Also at 34 weeks the likelihood of Tristyn (baby girl) needing NICU for a few weeks up to a month (closer to full term) is extremely likely. All of the unknowns, being separated from my husband and kids for an extended amount of time, Doug being so far away, and all of the variables associated with this are causing me a lot of stress and anxiety on top of the pain I’m dealing with daily and I’m trying to find ways to alleviate some of my stress in an attempt to avoid preterm labor and hospitalization.

Kristine High's Medical Expenses,"$2,700 raised of $10,000 goal","My life changed on 8/30/2015 when I woke up paralyzed from my lower lungs down and was rushed to the ICU.   It took until December and repeated hospital admissions to receive a diagnosis of Grave's Autoimmune Encephalitis.  

The disease is a rare autoimmune disease and a complication of Grave's disease which I was diagnosed with when I was 26.  I chose to have my Thyroid removed and take replacement hormones.  

Unfortunately autoimmune diseases can never be cured, only managed.  In my particular case, the antibodies that I carry in my bone marrow turned back on and launched an attack against my brain.  It has had devastating results on my body and as I write this, we have still been unable to find a treatment protocol to control it.   

I do not know what my long term prognosis will be. I am currently utilizing high dose steroids, Cellcept and IVIG transfusions to try to gain control of the disease but it is a slow process which has so far not improved anything.  

Between hospital stays and after utilizing all of my FMLA, I continued to try to work on a part time basis.  Unfortunately, after a recent hospital stay at the beginning of January, I was contacted by my company and told that I was terminated because I was a liability. Furthermore, my health insurance was canceled.  

Part of the lesson of this journey has been to learn that I need to ask for and accept help from others.    The prescription costs are very high as is the cost of COBRA.  It's an expensive disease.  The last round of 5 IVIG infusions alone cost $90,000.  I have started the process of applying for disability but it unfortunately not be a quick process.  Your help will help me cover the cost in the meantime.   

Thank you for taking the time to read my story.   I deeply appreciate any donations that are made.

Diane (Covey) Jackson with Medical Expenses,"$375 raised of $10,000 goal","Hi, this is Trina Morris & Chelsey Hale. We are starting this gofundme for our mom, Diane, who has been recently diagnosed with cancer. This all started in January with an ER visit, that turned into a couple of weeks of a hospital stay, surgeries, tests upon tests, the cancer diagnosis and now chemo. As you can imagine, the medical bills are high and only going up. Her husband, Mike, had to take an early retirement with this diagnosis to be home with her because Chels & I both work. She’s expected to have roughly 12 rounds of chemo and then possibly another surgery after to remove what’s left. Anything raised will go towards her medical bills so she can keep fighting!","Poteau, OK"

Medical expenses for 2 year old Simba!,"$1,025 CAD raised","Hi my name is Aleesha and I am creating this page for a friend who is dealing with some high medical expenses for her two year old Maine Coon cat, Simba.

Simba started acting unusual and would hiss if picked up. He stopped jumping on her counters and Ashley suspected it was pain related. Simba had lost weight and wasnt eating.She brought him to the vet 2 weeks ago where they ran blood work and a urine test. The Veterinarian diagnosed him with diabetes due to elevated sugar levels and sent them home with insulin injections. Two days after starting insulin, Simba went severely hypoglycemic. Ashley continued to do random blood glucose monitoring however he was well within normal ranges. His pain was getting notably worse and she rushed him back to the vet for x rays of his spine, pelvis and hips. The Vet reported he had double hip dysplasia and they would send his x rays to a specialist for confirmation. The specialist requested another x ray to be taken in a different position on his hips as he suspected double femoral head fractures. Yesterday they were able to complete another x ray which confirmed the specialists opinion. He is going to need a double FHO (femoral head ostecotomy) where they remove the ball entirely from both of his hip joints. These fractures were spontaneous and due to genetics. The surgeon states that this is needed urgently this week. After surgery he is going to need extensive Physiotherapy to strengthen those muscles. At this point, Ashley has spent $2000 to cover the wrong diagnosis initially, heavy pain medications and an appetite stimulator, perscription food and many different x rays/exams performed at the Vet. This surgery is expected to cost approximately $3000-$3500 per hip as well as the Physiotherapy and medications afterwords. She has to travel to an orthopedic surgeon to have this done as well. Any donations at all are very much appreciated. Ashley is doing the best that can she can under these circumstances. She isn't one to ask for help but I wanted to do whatever I could as she has 4 young kids working full time while trying to care for Simba.

Help Jordan Rozelle w medical expenses & recovery,"$20,871 raised of $85,000 goal","Hi family & friends, my name is Jordan Rozelle and I have recently been diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer. I am creating this fundraiser in order to get any support to help me with my recovery & medical expenses. Within the span of a week around Christmas time, I lost a tremendous amount of weight and woke up to an immense amount of stomach pain, along with bloating to the point where I couldn’t move or get out of bed. I admitted myself to the hospital a few days later and I have been here ever since. In 2021, I was diagnosed with testicular cancer, and unfortunately had to get one of my testicles removed. I thought that was the end of the situation, but it turns out that the cancer came back even stronger. I currently have tumors that have metastasized in my lymph nodes/testes, liver, kidneys, as well as lungs. I would be extremely grateful for any support I can get, whether it’s financial, emotional, or spiritual. All funds will go towards treatments such as chemo, alternative therapy, medication, supplements, dietary modifications, physical therapy, medical examinations, transportation/lodging, health insurance, current hospital stay, potential surgery, initial care, continuing care/maintenance, time off of work (as I have been using my savings), and additional resources or unexpected costs. I am in very high spirits and refuse to give up this fight because I know I am strong and will make it through this situation and come out stronger than I was before. Thank you all so much in advance.. I will keep you all updated with how my journey goes!

Jonathan Caouette Urgent Medical Expenses,"$97,942 raised of $95,000 goal","Hi,

As some of you know, 20 years ago next year I started working with Jonathan Caouette on the distribution of his groundbreaking, landmark documentary ""Tarnation."" I joined an amazing group of existing creative collaborators that included Stephen Winter, Brian Kates, John Cameron Mitchell, and Gus Van Sant. My former colleague Ryan Werner and I fell in love with the version of ""Tarnation"" we saw at Sundance in 2004 and one of the greatest creative and professional experiences of our careers was born. Also born back in January 2004 was a long and caring friendship with Jonathan, who's faced an enormous number of truly harrowing challenges in his life. Anyone who's seen ""Tarnation"" has a small idea of the massive challenges and overwhelming pressures he's faced and borne during his entire life.

Medical expenses,"$1,395 raised of $5,000 goal",Hi! I am raising money to try and help my sister Allison and her family. I feel led to do something. My sister had back surgery in January and she has since then gotten an infection and it is still there and she has been on multiple rounds of antibiotics and steroids. She found out Monday she has two blood clots and is on medicine to try and bust them up and now as of yesterday is having to go back in to Emory next week to have surgery again for a tumor that is pressing on her spine and she will be there for the week or longer. The tumor that they see may just be infection. We are not sure what they are going to do but we do know the infection is in her spine but she also has a shunt in her brain so they may have to do brain surgery if the infection has gotten in her shunt. We are praying that it is not in her shunt and they won't have to go in. She has not been able to work since January so I know the medical bills and other bills are rolling in. Her husband has to take off of work to take her back and forth to the doctor. We serve a mighty God and we know he is in control. Prayers are greatly appreciated!! Thank you all.,"Statham, GA"
Carman from Walmart Medical Bills,"$137,422 raised of $10,000 goal","I was shopping in Walmart in Arizona and spoke with Carmen an 82 year old woman; the door greeter. She was leaning on a shopping cart with her cane inside the cart. It broke my heart to see this elderly woman having to work.

Help needed. Medical expenses-necessities,"$225 raised of $2,000 goal","Hi. I HATE doing this and I hate posting a picture of my son but I am desperate for help.

My son had braces put on early last year with a different insurance than I have now. I received paperwork that said the braces were covered. I did not know that that meant they were only covered that year. Now that I have a new insurance I am having a hard time getting approved to continue service from a different insurance provider. I am fighting thru the red tape but I still need to continue my son’s appointments. He also received a root canal last year and my insurance did not cover or even pay a portion of the needed crown. The missing crown is causing a problem with his braces since the orthodontist cannot put brackets on a “tooth with a big hole in it”. I must get him a crown asap which is very expensive.

Help with Medical Expenses,$370 raised of $600 goal,"Hello, friends! I've hit a bit of a snag and could really use some extra support. Over the last few months I've had some pretty scary medical events that have resulted in high medical bills. The most intense of which was a fainting spell resulting in a concussion and I was placed on a month long heart monitor. Thankfully the many tests came back clear and no further action is needed, however the fees have started to rack up.
I am doing everything I can to pay this off on my own; I've received a promotion at work and have been putting in for the maximum hours, I am also searching for a part-time or temporary position to help gather the necessary funds and pay this off as soon as possible.
I hope to not have to collect the full amount but any help/support anyone could offer at this time would be greatly appreciated.

Help offset medical expenses for gastric bypass,"$300 raised of $3,500 goal","Hi everyone, my name is Dawn. Some of you know me, and some of you don’t.. but my hope is after sharing some of my story with all of you, you’ll get to know me a little better. I am going to be incredibly vulnerable for a moment. I’ve struggled with my weight most of my life, much of it was related to underactive hormones and PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome). I have always been ashamed of my weight, never felt worthy or pretty enough to amount to much of anything. I remember being teased and made fun of when I was in middle and high school. I was picked on in gym class, and having my clothes stolen or flushed down the toilet. A few chosen names that really stand out were being called MegaMoo and Snuffleupagus in the halls of of my high school. Some just chose to “moo” as I walked by. Notes and derogatory pictures stuck to my locker door. I wouldn’t wish those moments on my worst enemy. I will save you the details, but by the time I was in high school I needed hormone injection every 90 days to stop my monthly cycle d/t debilitating blood loss. My mom signed me up for my first Weight Watchers class at 13. She offered to buy me a brand new wardrobe and re-do my bedroom if I’d lose 50, 75 or 100 pounds. This only drove me to eat behind closed doors in silence. I felt as though my mother was just as ashamed of me as I was. Obviously I never earned a new wardrobe or bedroom re-do. Weight remained a constant struggle. My weight soared to its highest at 311 pounds when I had my daughter Avery. After she was born I had a uterine hemorrhage which resulted in an emergency hysterectomy. The doctors at OSU found that the hormone injections were to blame, but my weight merely fluctuated back and forth, staying around 290 pounds. In 2022, I endured the most horrific end to a relationship, it caused PTSD, which included several weeks of not eating, and not talking care of myself in general. I knew if I didn’t snap out of it, I was going to die. My weight dropped to 265 where I remain today. Over the years, I’ve done WW, Jenny Craig, Adkins, South Beach, nutritional supplements only, keto and so on. You might be wondering, “why now?” My answer is simple. Right now is where I am. I’m a recent empty-nester marrying off both of my kids this year.. so, I am finally taking a chance doing something for myself. In 2006, I was approved for gastric bypass (RNY) surgery based on weight alone. At that point in time, I had no health conditions to speak of. Back then, I let someone talk me out of it, and I have regretted it ever since. I have attempted to move forward with it a few times over the years, but it’s always been an exclusion on my health insurance. After a lot of research and soul-searching, I have decided to move forward with the procedure even though my insurance won’t cover it. The all-inclusive cost is about $6500 including airfare. The plan is to fly to Tijuana, Mexico in September for the surgery on 9/11. I will return on 9/14. I am reaching out to all of you asking if you’ll please consider making a donation to help offset some of the expense. I realize the procedure cost falls on me, and it’s not your responsibility. I am simply asking for extra support. I am working two jobs, but it’s getting harder and harder the older I get to keep the pace with my neuropathy. My PCP is in complete agreement and supports this decision. Any amount you can spare will be greatly appreciated. This option will allow for the best option to reverse my diabetes and improve my painful neuropathy. I plan to share this journey on my social media. Please inbox me or comment if you have any questions at all. Thank you for reading. If you don’t mind sharing, that would be wonderful. Thank you!

Shannon cover medical expenses,"$2,500 raised of $18,000 goal","Hi, my name is Kristen and I am trying to raise funds for a wonderful coworker and an even better friend. For those of you that know Shannon, there will be no doubt in your mind why I would say that! For those of you that don't, she always goes above and beyond to help anyone in need, both professionally and personally. She is a problem solver, but unfortunately this problem she can not solve on her own! For the past several months Shannon has gone from doctor to doctor searching for answers in regards to numbness in her fingers. About two months ago she received a call that changed her life forever. She was told that the numbness was caused by compression by a severe spinal cord compression in her neck from c2 through c7, and would need a posterior cervical laminectomy and spinal fusion. If she did not have the surgery, she could become paralyzed by a wrong turn of the head or as little as a sneeze. The surgery was her only option to avoid this, and the possibility of success with still small. There was a 30% chance that she would never walk again. Within two weeks she was in major surgery where they took out her vertebrae and replaced it with screws and titanium rods. They packed around the metal with cadaver bone in the hopes that her body would not reject the new bone. The concern was since the spinal cord had been compressed for so long, that when the compression was released it could have caused potentially permanent damage to other parts of the spine. Unfortunately, the only surgeon in the area willing to take the risk of completing the surgery was only able to complete it at a hospital that does not offer financial assistance. Thankfully, Shannon came through the surgery well but has a long road ahead of her. Sadly, the numbness in her hands worsened and with extensive physical therapy feeling may or may not return. She will have to figure out how to live with some of the damage that has occurred. The hope is that the nerves will regrow themselves, however, this may take several years and is not guaranteed. Shannon has health insurance, but even with the insurance has been left with piles of debt that continue to grow. She has been off from work for 7 weeks and has at least another 6 weeks at minimum to go. The hospital is requesting payments as high as a mortgage when she returns to work, and this surgery will likely need to be completed again in 7 to 10 years. Shannon has a heart of gold, and would never ask for help on her own. Please consider donating, as I can not possibly think of someone more worthy of your love.

Jennifer's Medical Expenses/Bills,"$3,780 raised of $5,000 goal","My long time friend Jennifer Bidwell was just recently diagnosed with breast cancer and multicentric disease.  This was a shock to us all and she just underwent a double bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction last Tuesday. She is recovering well but in alot of pain.  Her doctors do not think it has spread to her lymph nodes which is great news but she will have to undergo a few more surgeries, tests and doctor visits once she is healed from this one. The medical bills are high and keep coming in and insurance doesn't cover everything so I am reaching out to all of my friends and hers as well to help with any donations you can.  They have already exhausted their funds they have thus far and she has been unable to work as well.  Please dip deep and help our friend.  This campaign may increase as her bills do so I hope we can exceed this amount by far.  As many of you know Jennifer is a wonderful person, lover of animals and someone I care for deeply.  If you would like to donate outside of the Go Fund Me campaign please contact me and we can set something up as well.  She has a long way to go but she is alive and doing well and we are praying she will be cancer free forever.  She needs all your love, support and prayers.  Please help if you are able to and if not financially then prayers are accepted as well.  Please share as well. Thank you.

Medical Expenses,"$35,037 raised of $50,000 goal","Hi, my name is Madeleine Peraza; I am fundraising on behalf of Kaylee America Rodriguez.
Recently we have been struck with the petrifying news of Kaylee having cancer. This has impacted everyone due to the fact that Kaylee has been an athlete her whole life. Kaylee has impacted many by being the first girl on team Panama 12u, Four-Time All Miami Dade county first team, a six-time district Champion in Softball and 2-time district champion in soccer; in other words, a total beast. She succeeds in everything she does due to how decided and driven she is. Kaylee excelled and pushed hard, which granted her the opportunity to attend the University of Michigan. Kaylee has impacted the softball world but has left an even greater impact on the people around her as she is one of the best human beings I have ever come across. Kaylee has been a fantastic daughter and sister to her brothers Kassem and Keanu. Last year, her brother Keanu (17) was diagnosed with Burkitt's Lymphoma and fought and beat it on October 27th, 2021. On September 7th, 2022, we got the results no one wants to get, especially a young collegiate athlete- an MRI depicting two tumors. Last year Kaylee complained of hip pain; for those who know Kaylee, pain or hurt isn't a word in her vocabulary, nothing ever hurts. The news has struck everyone impacting coaches, teammates, friends, and family due to the recency of having Keanu beat cancer. We are asking for your prayers and for your respect of privacy to help Kaylee focus on beating cancers ass. We are also kindly and graciously asking for help covering the cost of school, medical bills, medicine, transportation, and other expenses while she is in the hospital, as Kaylee's friend, your support and just love for this amazing family. Over the past few years, I have gotten to know the Rodriguez/Gonzalez family on and off the field, who have included me in their family. To help this family and pray to keep them safe. Thank you, and God bless you all.

Alexis (Aleksis) Baich Cover Medical Expenses,"$9,215 raised of $7,000 goal","Hello everybody, my name is Alexis (Aleksis) Baich, and I am graciously asking for donations to help with medical expenses and debt caused by unexpected back surgery.

Five months ago, I began to experience severe, severe back pain. As a teacher and a coach this was very concerning, and the pain kept me bedridden away from my students and my teams for most of the spring semester of the 2021-2022 school year. The pain was so intense that basic everyday things such as sneezing, coughing, eating, and even laughing were debilitating at times. Walking was virtually impossible without the assistance of another person or use of a walker. Nothing brought relief. Heating pads, creams, physical therapy, even prescription-strength pain killers… everything was attempted and yet nothing helped. After visiting with a pain specialist, doctors thought they had finally located the problem. They explained that with a couple of localized injections my pain would to be gone. But first I needed an MRI just to verify the doctors had the correct diagnosis. Nothing could have prepared me for the days that followed.

Diane Dobson’s Medical Expenses,"$3,531 raised of $40,000 goal","My dear friend and business partner Diane, has always been a vibrant, and hard working woman. Her energy and humor is contagious and her generosity unparalleled.  She has a love for life and all those she touches.

Several months ago, she suffered from a diverticulitis attack. After visiting the ER, she went home with a high fiber protocol in an effort to remove what was diagnosed as a ""blockage in her colon"". After weeks of high fiber, antibiotics and lost work, her pain worsened only to bring her back to the ER again. This time, her kidney function had decreased and the infection and condition had worsened. We discovered that she never had a bowel blockage in the first place and the high fiber diet caused her to dehydrate, thus causing her kidneys to fail. After a long stay the hospital and home nursing care, Diane was admitted once again for surgery.

Diane has lost several months of work ( October to at least February) and is still to this day, not healed.

Any contribution that you can make to this wonderful woman's follow up appointments and home medical expenses would help her relax and would mean so much to us.

Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

Happy Holidays
Debbie

PS. Diane is not the type of person who would ever ask for anything as she is always the first one to help others. Your generosity, however small, would be most appreciated.

Help with Medical Expenses for Clayton Williams,"$2,550 raised of $5,000 goal","Hey!! My name is Leah Agnew and I am setting up this account to ask for donations of any amount for Clayton Williams (father of Ashley Williams).
  On August 20, 2021 Clayton was admitted to a local hospital due to COVID19 respiratory complications. After several days in the hospital he started having some other complications that are unfortunately a result of COVID19. He was transferred to Baptist Hospital in Jackson, MS and admitted to their COVID19 floor. His respiratory issues were improving, but the other complications were not. He was on many medications including blood thinners due to decreased blood flow to his lower extremities. COVID19 has so many unknowns, but research has shown that COVID19 can cause thickening of the blood and/ or blood clots. On 9/8/21 Clayton was moved to the regular vascular floor, therefore he could finally have visitors. He was finally able to see family after almost 3 weeks in isolation from anyone but medical staff. With his respiratory issues improving the doctors were finally able to address his vascular (blood flow) issues to his lower extremities. On 9/10/21, Clayton had a procedure call an angioplasty (procedure to check blood flow in his lower extremities and ""fix"" if possible). During the procedure the vascular doctor was not able to do anything to help with his blood flow and gave him the news no one ever wants to here. The damage to both feet and lower legs is irreversible and to prevent any further damage he will have to have both lower legs amputated. The first surgery to remove both legs at just below the knee is scheduled for Weds, 9/15/21. Clayton does currently have medical insurance, but with high deductibles he has already started receiving medical bills. As of right now his current insurance will end 12/31/21. He will be requiring several surgeries, rehabilitation, physical therapy, medical equipment, etc... Once he does get to come home from the hospital he will be living full time with his daughter Ashley, which also causes more financial strain on both of them. I am asking for donations for any amount. Anything will be greatly appreciated.

Sandra's medical expenses in the Philippines,"$2,520 raised of $20,000 goal","Hi,
  I am reaching out to everyone to help my sister in behalf of her son in the Philippines for her to recover and survive this medical ordeal we are currently facing. Here is his letter for everyone:
  My mother experienced a heart attack and was desperate for air last Jan, 1, 2022 at close to midnight of Jan, 2, 2022. It has been an ordeal right from the start since we are unable to find a hospital that will accept her condition and fully attend to her. During that journey itself, we've already paid around close to 20000 pesos to keep alive with oxygen and emergency help from a nearby hospital. Unfortunately, they are not fully equipped and we were forced to find a new hospital to fully attend to her. We were able to land on a hospital right away and it was only then on the 3rd or 4th we got attended since the small oxygen tank we bought only had less than an our of oxygen to support her. From the emergency room they were able to take a few tests and we found out that it was indeed a heart attack that happened which may have cause some problems to her other organs too (she was also diagnosed with pneumonia with the tests made). Her vital were good for a few days in the hospital but she was already hooked up to a heart rate monitor the entire time to monitor her heart, oxygen levels, respiratory rate and blood pressure to say the least. But things slowly took for the worse on the 3rd day, she began experiencing fever and an elevated blood pressure. And on the 4th night, things took even worse as she experience another heart attack which resulted into a cardiac arrest. It was painful to see my mother's heart rate monitor flat line and took her last breath but the medical team did their best and was able to revive her. But during this, I can see my mother's suffering as she fight for her life especially when they were trying to intubate her. I can see how painful it must have been for her especially while they were trying to intubate her to get her oxygen levels back to normal. She was even given big doses of medicine several times to get her calm and sleep but it must have been very painful for her during that time and it was not able to get her to sleep. After a few more doses she was able to sleep and she was fully intubated but still wakes up from time to time because of a pain she is experiencing in her chest. She then has been transferred to the ICU facility and hooked up to a very large breathing apparatus. Today, as of writing, on her 6th day at the hospital, her doctor called and advised us that she is now experiencing kidney issues as well and her creatinine is very high and now found blood on her urine And she is now needed to be referred to a fourth doctor, a Nephrologist to find out what wrong with her kidney. Over the course of 24 hrs her hospital bill skyrocketed with a 100000PHP difference in less than 24 hrs from being transferred to ICU, then add to that her current bill from her 1st day of confinement. I am not sure how high her bill will go up since she would need to undergo angiogram to find out what's wrong with her heart by the time she is capable to do so.

Mom's Medical Expenses,"$3,070 raised of $10,000 goal","My name is Emily Dougherty. My mom has always been one of the most influential and important people in my life. When I was little she worked at a hospital as a pharmacy technician. She inspired me to help people. That's why I want to do this for her, with your help. My mom has an immune deficiency called Common Varialble Immune Deficiency that is detrimental to her health. She discovered this when she was seeking treatment for an injury that disabled her. Around the same time she found out that she has lesions on her brain. My mom hasn't had an easy life and just when she tries to help herself she finds out that things are worse than she originally thought. The only thing I want for her is for her health to come back and for her to be the happy energetic mom she once was. This money will go directly to her treatment that she will need for the rest of her life. The treatment for CVID is immunoglobulin replacement therapy, which is very costly, but even more neccesary for her immune system and srength. I can't imagine life without her, by doing this you will be saving not one, but multiple lives because she means the world to my family. The amount of your donation doesn't matter. The fact that you donate or share the message does, because every dollar adds up. This money adds up to save a life, the one that is most important to me. Any amount helps and even if you can't donate yourself you can still support my family by sharing our story.

My brother’s medical expenses,"$19,363 raised of $50,000 goal","Hi my name is Ashley and im making this for my brother JC. He was admitted on June 26 and has been in critical care ever since. Three months prior to being admitted he was feeling lethargic, shortness of breath, difficulty sleeping, heaviness in his legs, and difficulty with expressing his words (aphasia). He went from living in a 27 year old normal life working and studying as a mechanic to quickly deteriorating in a matter of two weeks including not being able to walk, difficulty eating/swallowing food, hand tremors, extreme shortness of breath, and insomnia to being intubated in the hospital. All of this has been the most terrifying experience because the worst part is that none of the doctors can figure out what’s going on. All of his lab results have been negative or insignificant to a point where the health professional cannot make a single diagnosis. They believe it is an autoimmune disease or possibly something genetic that is causing all of his symptoms. He is currently receiving care at Baptist main hospital and is on a ventilator connected to a tracheotomy. He developed aspiration pneumonia when he was first admitted and from then on he has been on a ventilator. His R lung is currently collapsed with a paralyzed R side diaphragm causing difficulty breathing and build up of mucus in his lungs. He currently needs more specialized neurologist and geneticist on his case; however Baptist main does not have the resources or tools to provide him the care he needs. We requested for a transfer where they have more resources and he was denied from Jackson for “administrative reasons” and will not provide a reason. We need him to be transferred and possibly hire a private EMS to transfer him ourselves. I am hoping to anyone sees this to please donate to help us find answers for my brother. The worst thing is not knowing and hopefully to anyone who reads this will help us find answers by donating or anything to help. Please I am asking for help, not for me but for my brother and my parents who have been so supportive, sleeping at the hospital every night, and never leaving his side.

Every month she had to attend a chemotherapy hospital for an 8-hour drip of Benlista to help the autoimmune disease that made her so sick for 3-5 days throwing up the toxins from the medicine. She was also diagnosed with Pancreatitis 20 years ago which caused such bad pain under her right rib daily she was constantly battling chronic nausea from both her Lupus and Pancreatitis.

Helping My Father With Financial Burdens,"$1,830 raised of $100,000 goal","My fathers (Mr Moses) journey began in 2018 when he was diagnosed with Prostate Cancer. This was very difficult for him too deal with. However, my father is a proud man and he accepted his situation. He was prescribed a chemo drug, which he dutifully took, 7 days a week. A side affect of that drug was high blood pressure. So, he started with blood pressure medication too. The liquid filled pills were awfully big and hard to swallow. I watched him night after night take these chemo pills and it was obviously difficult, but he wanted to do what the doctors told him to do so he could continue with his work and life in general.

Then on November 4th of 2018, an event occurred which would forever alter my father's and my life. In the early AM my father had a serious stroke. I remember he called me on my phone from his phone. He said you better get up here. I dressed quickly and went upstairs. I found my father slumped partly on his bed. I immediately tried asking him what was wrong, but even then, the stroke was causing serious problems on my fathers brain. He had a medium sized bleed on the left side of his brain which caused immediate paralysis of his right side arm, leg, neck, face.

However, due to previous and on-going medical procedures we are hoping to alleviate a portion of the financial burden these obstacles have created.

In 2020 Teva was struggling with severe pain. After many doctors and appointments it was decided to attempt exploratory surgery to determine a potential diagnosis. Teva was then diagnosed with endometriosis at stage 3. This led to 6 months of chemotherapy through a drug called Lupron, sending her into menopause at 22. Shortly after completing chemotherapy Teva underwent a full hysterectomy in 2021. As you can imagine, recovery was prolonged and very difficult.

I had to stop working in May because he simply cannot be left alone. He has lost use of his hands, his speech has been terrible a while now, and now his legs are going. He is sacrificing his body and time doing experimental treatments, in hopes of finding a cure. Not just for him, but for anyone in the ALS Community (PALS). He is on his second round of experimental treatments at John Hopkins. Also he is committed to keeping doing the experiments as long as his body will allow him to do so. Durning this experimental treatment we have to travel to John Hopkins once a week. Every other week we have to stay in the hospital for 8 hours when he receives the drug or the placebo we don't know. It gets injected into his spine. I've waited 7 months to become his paid caretaker, which is barely anything and they only give me 24.5 hours a week. We only get social security for him they won't give it to us for our kids. We are scraping by the skin of our teeth at this point. We've had one person help us out, it's just not enough.

It is very hard for us to ask for help especially from strangers, it's just at that swallow your pride point. Bless you all and your families, stay well!

Michael's Medical School Applications,"$5,680 raised of $5,000 goal","Over the last eight years, I developed my deep desires for creating meaningful relationships and exploring medicine through volunteering at the local hospital, participating in three medical research projects, and shadowing physicians. These experiences have shown me that good doctors diagnose and treat illnesses, but the best doctors empathize and communicate compassionately with their patients and team members. Furthermore, I have seen firsthand the impact of economic class and social factors on health. During college, I relied on Medical Assistance programs, which made finding accessible and quality healthcare extremely difficult. During my medical practice, I will strive to be aware of and relate to these often-unseen obstacles that patients must tackle alongside their medical conditions and health concerns. The next step to achieving this goal is applying to medical school, which can cost upwards of $5,000. If you would like to help me lessen the financial burden that comes with applying to medical school, you can donate to this campaign. Thank you so much for all your support.","Apple Valley, MN"

Mark Hodsdon’s Cancer Treatment Fundraiser,"$9,845 raised","As many of you know, Mark has been battling multiple myeloma and it has not been easy. His oncologist continues to search for a chemo drug that will help put Mark into remission. Right now the cancer is winning, and as a result, the drugs are getting more expensive to continue changing treatments and finding one that will ultimately work.

Mark’s new treatment is very expensive at almost $4000 for one round of treatment - that’s just four pills. Insurance doesn’t cover enough to ease the financial burden this treatment brings. The high costs are a drain both financially and emotionally. We are asking for whatever help possible towards these treatment costs, as the medical bills associated with his continued cancer fight are high, and feel endless. We are hopeful that God has a plan with these pills, even at the financial cost that comes with them. We pray that this treatment is the answer - there must be a miracle coming!

Life changing HSCT treatment for MS,"£11,556 raised of £46,000 goal","Hi everyone, my name is Nicola, and I’m reaching out to share my journey and seek your support. In 2017, I received a life-changing diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). Through 30 years of working for the NHS, I’ve dedicated my life to caring for others. Little did I know that MS would eventually impact my own life in unimaginable ways.

Despite trying various disease modifying drugs, my condition continued to worsen, leading me to participate in the STAR-MS trial. The trial involved comparing a high-efficacy drug Alemtuzumbab, against aHSCT. This was a randomised trial, unfortunately I received the DMD, which I underwent in January this year. Unfortunately, in April, I experienced another major relapse that left me with limited mobility on my left side. It has become clear that Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (AHSCT) is my best hope for recovery.

 However, AHSCT comes with a significant financial burden. The treatment, not including the travel to  Mexico, amounts to £46,000. As many others facing similar challenges, I am unable to cover this cost on my own.

That’s why I’m humbly reaching out to you, my friends, family, and kind-hearted individuals, for your support.

I understand the value of every contribution,whether it’s a donation, advice, support, or assistance with fundraising efforts. Even the smallest gesture can make a tremendous difference. If each person donated just £1, we could reach our goal together. I’m actively working on fundraising

On top of that, we got the pharmacy call his first round of meds were ready to pick up. $5,000 would be the copay. Luckily, after applying for more financial assistance that cost was brought down to zero for this month, but we aren't sure how long that will last. They say there's different avenues for financial help through this so we are chasing down each one of them.

I can't do much to make this easier for my family, but I will try everything I possibly can.  No one tells you about the financial strain of cancer, and we're only a few months in. He doesn't know I'm doing this, but I'm hoping together, maybe we can help lift some of that burden off my mom and dad.  What a blessing it would be!!

And... I'm pushing it, but...  if we're lucky, a dream come true would be making his dream come true to see Wyoming and Montana. It would mean the world to get him there but there is no way we could ever do it without help!

Consider donating to help my parents & share this with anyone you know who may consider giving. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for any support you will give! ♥️

Medical Expense have gotten out of hand,"$2,385 raised of $6,900 goal","Hi, my name is Leo; thank you for taking a moment.
I have Life-altering Stage 5 kidney failure. The current treatment runs 8 hours a day. Seven days a week for life-saving Peritoneal dialysis. I have a fixed income (Social Security).

Please Help Save My Dad,"$10,150 raised of $15,000 goal","Hi everyone,

My name is Nora and I'm hoping you can help save my dad. He's had numerous health issues over the past 30 years and the cost of health care has been a huge burden. I can't take away his pain, worry, and suffering, but I hope to be able to take away some of the financial burden of medical care.

His story may be long, but I promise it’s worth your time…

In 1985, at 22, with a wife and 2 small children, he underwent open-heart surgery to replace his aortic heart valve that was damaged by bacteria he received while having his teeth cleaned. Three years later doctors discovered that he contracted Hepatitis C from the blood transfusion during heart surgery. Hepatitis C causes long-term damage to the liver with no known cure or effective treatment at the time. While undergoing a routine CT scan to monitor his liver, doctors discovered a malignant tumor in one of his kidneys. The kidney was removed to prevent the spread of cancer. In 1998, he underwent experimental treatment, similar to chemotherapy, to cure Hepatitis C but was unsuccessful. Along the way, he developed type 1 diabetes, likely from an autoimmune response related to his other medical issues. He was hospitalized due to kidney failure caused by a kidney stone and diabetes management was difficult, so he was eventually put on an insulin pump to help reduce the damage to his remaining kidney. He later began to experience severe ascites (fluid in the abdomen) due to liver failure and each week underwent paracentesis (catheter inserted into his abdomen) to remove over 7 liters of fluid. During all of this he continued to work full time without complaint, even though fatigue was a major side effect of his condition. He was eventually added to the liver transplant list and received a donor liver 14 months later and must take immunosuppressant drugs the rest of his life to prevent rejection.

Transplant patients that were infected with Hepatitis C prior to surgery continue to be infected following surgery. Immunosuppressant drugs weaken the immune system which accelerates replication of Hepatitis C that damages the new liver (cirrhosis) and increasing the likelihood of needing another transplant in as little as 5 years. Since the number of transplant patients exceeds the supply, it's unlikely he would receive another donor liver.

A new drug called Harvoni was released in October that has a high success rate (98%) for curing Hepatitis C and stopping future damage to his liver. The bad news, the cost is $94,500 for the 12-week treatment ($1125 per pill!).

, and although insurance has covered some of that, the financial burden has been extremely difficult. During the past 30 years that my dad has been suffering, he has NEVER used his setbacks as an excuse, and has ALWAYS been an amazing husband, father, son, brother, and friend.  so he can begin treatment with the new drug and offset some of the cost of past and future medical needs and share many more years with his wife, children and grandchildren.

If you are also struggling and cannot donate, please just raise awareness. Thank you so much.

Emergency Funds fur Chance & Jack's Hoomanz,"$1,600 raised","This GFM is to help Chance & Jack's family with bills arising from a serious medical emergency. High gas prices, multiple long trips to see a specialist, and unexpected medical costs have caused a financial burden, unmanageable without help. We're asking our friends to please help us while our mom Carla P. receives critical treatment for a condition that can be fatal if not treated properly. She and her doctor have been fighting with the insurance company, which has denied her lifesaving drug: Cresemba. If she has to pay out of pocket, it will cost approximately $1500 per week! Not only that, her condition is so severe she will need to be on this drug for months!

Help Todd with Alzheimer Medical Costs,"$8,431 raised of $12,700 goal","Hello, our friend Todd Piltingsrud was diagnosed with Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease in July of 2023. Since then, he lost his job due to the disease, hasn't yet qualified for disability insurance, has had to utilize COBRA for health care/insurance, and, on a very positive note, has qualified at Mayo Hospital for a very newly approved drug, Lecanemab, that will greatly slow the mental cognitive decline. Kit's insurance options do not include Mayo, so they are forced to stay on COBRA for 2024. We are hoping to reduce the financial burden on the Piltingsrud's by covering the costs of the 2024 COBRA insurance and deductible associated with his health care and insurance needs.

These costs for 2024 are $12,700. If we could raise that amount, it will provide the family stability to ensure that he can continue on this new drug and that they can stay in their house. Please help us raise this amount of money so that they can focus on managing Todd's disease and some stress reduction that comes when financial concerns enter the picture.

Help Jordan in his battle to beat Cancer,"$85,983 CAD raised of $75,000 goal","Hi, I’m Jordan and I am raising money to help cover some of the financial burden of my battle with Cancer. Starting immediately, and over the coming months, I will be undergoing surgery and radiation followed by physical therapy and whatever additional treatments might be needed to beat this thing. Recovery time won’t be known until after my surgery and the doctors are able to fully assess what needs to be done. From what we understand, we are looking at the better part of a year. Unfortunately, for the foreseeable future this means I won’t be able to work. As we all know when things like this happen life doesn’t stop. The bills keep coming and regrettably I am not in a position that I can afford to absorb all the costs of life and the additional costs of transportation, accommodation, medications and recovery while not being able to work. This is where I lean on you. I’ve set an aggressive but realistic financial target based on the information I currently have. Without knowing exactly how long I’ll be off, what further treatments I will need and how long the rehab will take it’s hard to know what the actual cost will be and for that reason I think it’s important that you understand where your money will go while I’m recovering and what will happen when I’m recovered. My intention is to use any money raised to help cover my costs of living and healing. That could include rides to and from the hospital, meals, physio therapy, medications and any other daily cost while I’m out of work. If by any chance there is any money left from this effort when I have recovered I will donate the remaining funds to the Bras Drug Development Program at Princess Margaret Hospital to do my part to continue the aid in the fight against Cancer.

Deedee’s Fight,"$3,820 raised of $5,000 goal","As most of you know our mama was diagnosed with Stage 3 Ovarian Cancer. She has put up a hard fight and is winning. But, that fight has not come without a financial burden. Cancer treatments, multiple medicines, time off work, traveling to and from doctors appointments have all put a dent in her savings and leave from work. My brother and I are alternating paying for her chemotherapy to take that burden off of her that her insurance doesn’t cover (which why any cancer patient has to worry about paying for a drug to keep them alive is beyond me), but that doesn’t take away from the excess hospital bills, additional medicine, surgery fees and everything else that comes with this undeserving illness. I would like to throw this together to give her a little reprieve and ease the stress on her and my step dad as she is on a leave of absence from work due to her surgery. She normally works through the sickness and lethargy while on chemotherapy most days and if you know my mama you know she she is a work horse, but she just cannot do it right now. She has only three more treatments left and we want her to focus solely on that and her health instead of getting back to work. She has never been one to ask for help and I will likely get in trouble for this-but if you know my mama you know she is independent and head strong ( sounds familiar) but would give the shirt off of her back to anyone and would never ask for anything in return. Any amount will help. If you can’t help if you would keep her in your prayers we greatly appreciate it.

Bill is currently the  Sr. Engineer at the Carlyle.  I have provided the link below to learn more about his cancer.   He has gone through the usual chemo & radiation protocols and unfortunately it is not tackling his cancer. At this time we are researching clinical and alternative options. As you may or may not know, these treatments are not covered by insurance. There are several treatments and medications we would like try and that is why we are starting this GO FUND ME.  We appreciate any donations to help us explore other options. 


https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/esophageal-cancer/coping-side-effects

Treating stage IV cancer of the esophagus
Stage IV esophageal cancer has spread to distant lymph nodes or to other distant organs.

In general, these cancers are very hard to get rid of completely, so surgery to try to cure the cancer is usually not a good option. Treatment is used mainly to help keep the cancer under control for as long as possible and to relieve any symptoms it is causing.

Chemo may be given (possibly along with targeted drug therapy) to try to help patients feel better and live longer, but the benefit of giving chemo is not clear. Radiation therapy or other treatments may be used to help with pain or trouble swallowing.

For cancers that started at the gastroesophageal (GE) junction, treatment with the targeted drug ramucirumab (Cyramza) may be an option at some point. It can be given by itself or combined with chemo. Another option at some point might be treatment with the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab (Keytruda). 

Some people prefer not to have treatments that have serious side effects and choose to receive only treatments that will help keep them comfortable and add to their quality of life. For more information on treatments that may be helpful, see Palliative Therapy for Esophageal Cancer.

Escaping Gaza To Pursue My Dream In Medicine,"$22,212 AUD raised of $65,000 goal","If you would like to confirm the validity of this campaign, you can message either Bashar or I on Instagram. Our usernames are basharinshasi and darina.bishop and our accounts are public. Here is Bashar's story:

I have carried the dream of studying medicine since childhood, but now that my dream has become more important and my goal of studying medicine has become an unavoidable goal regarding what I saw of the dire need for doctors in my city of Gaza in this war that we are still living in until this moment. I write this letter after more than four months of bombing, destruction, starvation, and genocide to which we are subjected. I took the first steps in realizing my dream after I finished my high school and obtained a 99.6 % and ranked second in my country after struggling and studying in order to obtain a scholarship because my family isn’t able to afford my medical school costs. I registered at the Al-Azhar University majored in medicine through the scholarship of His Excellency the President, and I had started studying in September.2023, and I had only completed approximately two weeks on my dream path before this war began and the occupation bombarded my university and demolished it, as it did in all the universities of the Gaza Strip, and my dream has vanished along with it. The financial burden on my father has become unbearable , especially in light of the bad conditions caused by the war and the destruction of my house. My father may need many years to rebuild it and put everything he owns maybe. At the end, I aspire to be an extraordinary doctor in my field, in order to help the people of my city, Gaza, who are suffering from various physical disabilities , such as amputations and others, and health problems caused by the war and the killing of many, many medical teams while performing their duties in hospitals, clinics and medical facilities, which led to the collapse if the health system in the Gaza Strip, so I hope to continue my dream of studying this specialty as soon as possible.

Help our father undergo an open heart surgery.,"$18,573 raised of $50,000 goal","Dear friends and loved ones, my family and I are reaching out to you during these difficult and urgent times for our beloved father whilst fighting for his life in England. Whilst on holiday, visiting my brother in UK he suffered a massive heart attack and stroke compounded by his preexisting diabetes. He had 4 drug eluding stents placed in his heart but became critically unwell, with insertion of a life sustaining balloon pump, intubation and ventilation. Despite the doctors' best efforts to save his life, he remains critical and as such not able to travel back home. The complexity of his medical condition including heart attack, stroke, and diabetes has led to an extended stay in the hospital where he is fighting every day to recover. This unexpected medical emergency has resulted in mounting hospital bills, a financial burden we were not prepared for. Unfortunately, he is not entitled to free medical treatment in UK and his medical care is overwhelming for the family. We are kindly asking for your support in these trying moments. The funds raised would go directly towards covering his hospital bills and also to ensure he continues to receive the necessary medical treatments especially him needing an open-heart surgery. Every donation no matter the amount would bring him a step closer to recovery to return home safely. In these moments of despair, your support means everything to us. It does not only help alleviate the financial strain but gives us hope and strength every passing day. We promise to keep you updated on his progress and are forever grateful for any support.

Rob Boisvert's Medical Fund,"$18,280 raised of $75,000 goal","My name is Janine Boisvert. I am writing this on behalf of my wonderful husband Robert Boisvert. We have been married for 27 years, we have two children, Brian and Danielle, and we have two grandchildren.  In December 2015, after a barrage of doctor’s appointments, tests, and blood work he received a devastating diagnosis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, ALS.  This diagnosis has had a massive impact on our family and has changed our lives forever.  Up until recently, we had been managing fairly well on our own with help from family, friends, doctors, and the ALS Association of CT’s equipment loan closet.  In the summer of 2017, a new drug was approved for the treatment of all ALS patients called Radicava.  It is the first time in 22 years that a drug for ALS has been approved by the FDA.   Learning about Radicava was the first time our family felt hope as it was a step towards a cure for this debilitating disease.  Unfortunately, this hope has been ripped away as we have been denied three different times for the drug by our insurance company.  Rob's doctors believe that he is a great candidate for the medication and they believe that it will help him.  We are asking for help paying for the medication.   At over $1,000 an injection, the regimen
is 2 weeks for the first cycle (14 days on medication and 14 days off medication) and 10 days for all subsequent cycles (10 days on medication and 14 days off medication).  This medication places an extreme financial burden on our family.  Our ask is very time sensitive request since Rob will turn 65 in June and we are hoping that Medicare will cover the cost of the medication.  However, we need to get him started as soon as possible in order to bring back some of the hope that was lost.  Your loving donation is greatly needed and appreciated.

USF Minorities In Medicine Scholarship Fund,"$1,080 raised of $1,000 goal","Minorities in Medicine at the University of South Florida acknowledge the financial burden college poses for students, especially those from minority groups. To combat this, we have started this GoFundMe in hopes of raising up to $500 in funds to award to one USF Minorities in Medicine member to assist in school expenses such as tuition, room and board, books, and more. Any excess donations will be implemented into Minorities in Medicine initiatives and future projects. The winner will be announced in April at our end of year event.

MIM Mission Statement:
Five traits help to identify a minority group: (1) unequal treatment and less control over their life; (2) differentiating physical or cultural traits, such as skin color or language; (3) forced membership in the group; (4) knowledge of subordination; and (5) a high rate of in-group marriage. The LGBTQ community, persons who practice a religion that is not frequently practiced where they reside, and people with disabilities are more examples of minority groups. This club's goal is to unify all USF students involved in the field of medicine these five characteristics.

“Help Lisa fight the battle”,"$6,415 raised of $20,000 goal","Lisa would like to thank you all for your continued support in this tough battle against lupus. Lisa is still struggling each day but the generosity from all of you gives Lisa hope. It is however, with sadness that Lisa's treatments have now changed due to chemotherapy further weakening her already impaired immune system from this awful killing disease, ""lupus"". This resulted in a life threatening sepsis blood infection that put Lisa in ICU for over a week. It was this life altercation and other declining health issues, that doctors involved in Lisa's care have said ""no more"" and come to realize that with continued chemothearpy treaments, Lisa will continue to eventullay decline at a quicker rate, causing more harm then good to her body, making Lisa completely susceptible to other infections that have already once threatened her life. This now changes alot more in Lisa's life then we had expected. What this means now is that, chemotherapy is no longer an option; which was Lisa's hope to slow down the progession of Lupus nephritis (stage 4) which eventually will go to end stage renal failure if not treated aggressively enough like chemotherapy. This then would require dialysis and eventually a kidney transplant. With the possibility of Lupus attacking the kidney transplant and the process starts for Lisa all over again. I know in my heart a process in which Lisa could not bare anymore. This brings Lisa to where we are now, as a result of this, Lisa will not be able to work as her disease has already started to decline making it very difficult for Lisa to do alot of things that she so much loves to do, most importantly not being able to spend true quality time with her family and friends. It seems all they get to see is the ugly no matter how hard Lisa tries to hide it. This disease is robbing not only Lisa's family but her gentle, kind, caring spirit as well, and that is not Lisa. In the meantime, Lisa has applied for long term disability in which she has been advised could take anywhere from 4-6 months to obtain. Lisa as stated in her original story does not qualify for short term sick leave from EI at the moment, as she does not meet the requirements of 600 hours needed in order to obtain a new claim. Due to a previois claim from a complication of Lupus that resulted in finger amputation. So once again Lisa is faced with yet another unessasay challenge. Lisa had previously worked two part time jobs to make up for full time, until recently in her story had to cut one of them because the Lupus made it too difficult on her body and therefore the hours she did try to work still did not qualify Lisa to meet the requirements to accumulate a health benefit package or to reapply for sick benefits to help Lisa in her time of need. This unfortunate circumstance now brings Lisa here asking others for help. Those who know Lisa will know that just by asking for finacial help alone is killing her not to mention the humiliation it has brought upon her, as Lisa believes there should be other options available to anyone that might have to be faced with this or going through such a terrifying and scary ordeal, let along have to worry about financial hardship and medical expenses. It is humiliating enough to know that people such as Lisa have to endure such unnecessary hardships. Regardless of Lisa's illness and the humiliation she feels, the reality of it is, Lisa will still require financial help in paying her living expenses and current medications to keep Lisa somewhat comfortable until her disabilty hopefully gets approved. Again that process can take anywhere from 4-6 months and finaces wait for no one. WE have also exhausted all of our resources when it comes to social assistance as they do not even give anywhere near what they think is the cost of living now a days to survive especially when you have a child. Another thing Lisa would like to look into. So again Lisa is faced with yet another unessasay challenge and struggle. As stated, financial burden and hardships of Lisa's illness still require help until Lisa can hopefully obtain proper help from the government. This still puts a lot of stress on Lisa as she has a 12 year old daughter that also deserves better. Lisa says she is blessed however and tries to find the positive in all of this because she has amazing support from her mother beyond belief and her friends, but unfortunately Lisa's mother works as a baker at foodland grocery store that barley pays for her to get by. All that Lisa's mom has and makes goes without question to Lisa's needs. Unremarkable! Selfishness! So with your continued support we are hoping that we can eleviate some of this financial burden that otherwise would cause a great deal of stress on Lisa's body and therefore cause a really bad Lupus flare up that she might not make it out of this time. Lisa's poor body has had enough and there is only so much fight one individual can endure on their own and believe me Lisa has done just that. The money would continue to go for things like Lisa's financial needs to include all necessary living costs, the medication required to keep her comfortable at home as nothing has changed for Lisa's situation or illness since she has been home. Lisa still continues to experience all the same symptoms just now more intensified. Medications to treat Lisa's constant nausea and vomiting, heartburn, difficulty swallowing, intense pain medication, blood pressure medication even though Lisa has changed her diet completely to a much more healthy approached then even before but again healthier eating requires a huge increase in grocery bills and Lisa is again forced to choose between her health and financial needs. Another system Lisa would like to see fixed and is on her list. Theraputic services to help with Lisa's deep excruciating muscle pain, help with care giver relief and counsellors needed for all Lisa's family members closely involved that need help and unfortunately require it now. Another system that Lisa has put on her list that needs fixing. There is still so many to list and Lisa would be more then happy to share with you just ask. The goal in continuing to collect these funds is in hopes to elevate some of Lisa's financial burdens until the government hopefully steps in and provides her with the proper care. In the meantime why should this caring, loving person who would and has not thought twice about helping someone in need have to struggle when we all can help. Let's make this about helping someone's ""quality"" of life and not ""quanity"" pain and suffering have no business in life. Life is meant to be lived ""happy"" no matter what a person's situation. All I ask is that we help eleviate some of this pain that's all. Although Lisa is still hopeful that there will be a cure for Lupus one day, Lisa's struggles are still very real and she may not make it to see that day. This is where is isn't just about one person anymore, Lisa would like This fund to go world wide so that when it has served it's purpose in helping Lisa, it doesn't stop there. It is Lisa's greatest wish and hope that this tragic illness of Lupus not be the end but rather a start to something even bigger ""hope"" for all that struggle. To create an on going fund in assisting others in need so they may focus on the living side to what ever extent they may have instead of spending it on the negative aspect of the situation with things like finacial burden and letting the disease win because lack of hope. Lisa's experience has showed that there has to be a better way . This fund is only the beginning. So Lisa's has asked once again that you share your stories , share her page, reach out to her family and friends with ideas on ways for to get the word out about real life finacial struggles while being sick and to help make this fund world wide, available for all who need help. Please remember what Lisa said it's not always about monetary help but sometimes the best help of all is ""kindness"" Again, thank you all for your continued support and please help make a difference. You never know when this this could become you. THE STORY Lisa Noss has been battling the war against Lupus for many years now. Up until now, Lisa has had a good run of managing her disease even through the many hardships that it brings. Some to include; amputation of digits, in and out of hospitals for three months at a time, surgery, bone marrow and spinal tests and kidney biposy to name a few. Not to mention all the trips to the specialists and other hospitals like the University of Toronto Lupus clinic and Mount Sinai. Sick Children’s Hospital when she was younger. Recently Lisa has been diagnosed with stage 4 Lupus Nephritis and is one of the most serious manifestations of systemic lupus eryematous (SLE). Lisa reqires aggresive treatment now which involves Chemotherapy. The goal for Lisa in doing this type of treatment is to hopefully slow down the progression of the disease to end stage renal failure. From there Lisa would require dialysis and evetually need a kidney transplant. Lisa was able to manage some of her medication throughout the years because she had worked two part time jobs that made up for full time hours and compensated for not having a health plan. Since Lisa has been recently been diagnosed with Lupus Nephritis she has now had to cut one of her part time jobs complety, as it became very hard on her body. With that came financial burden and further hardship. Lisa is not able to afford all of her medication, so she has to pick and choose which ones she needs the most in order to just get by, even though all medication she takes now are eqally important to her health. Lisa would not have been able to even get this type of treatment had it not of been for physician to have her approved for a clinical trial because the cost is just to great. Lisa has still tried to work her one part time job throughout treatment because she needs the medication which is very expensive to help her coupe with the side effects of chemotherapy such as; vomiting, nausea, headaches and poor appetite. Though Lisa’s admiration and bravery and her will to continue not to give up, it's unfortunate that her body is. This is making it more difficult for Lisa to work and the increase in sick’s days from work have greatly impacted her financial status. Lisa now does not pay for any medications during chemotherapy that can help allieveate some of her symptoms because the cost is to much and she has other financial priorities that take place first like food, rent, bills and raising a 12 year old daughter. Lisa has tried many private and work health benefits for part time, all in which have very high premium rates and some just denied. Lisa has also tried other means of government plans such as Trillium Drug benefit plan but this has a very high deductible and has to be paid in quartly and some of the medication she needs the most they won’t even cover. Lisa is giving it all she has got but the chemo treatments are wearing her out and she has had to call in sick more so now. This creates a huge financial stress on Lisa. Lisa can not apply for sick leave from enemployment because she had recently used up all her benefits from a previous complication of lupus that required her finger to be amputated. Therefore Lisa was told she would have to make up another 600 hours before she could apply for sick leave again. Lisa is then forced to work even though physicians and her own body have advised against it. However Lisa states that ”the bills won’t pay them self’s and my 12 year old needs a mom that can look after her“ Lisa barely gets through her shifts now as it is, doing whatever means necessary to just get by the day. No one going through chemotherapy or any kind of an illness should have to go through this without some kind of relief. Lisa has continued to show her bravery and courage through out her difficult time and still has not given up. Lisa should be able to recieve the medication she needs and should not have to suffer as should anyone else going through such diffucilt times. Lisa loves life and her family, that is truly why I believe she is still with us today. Her will and determination not to give up but go on no matter what comes her way is just truly inspirational. Lisa is a very caring and giving person herself. she is always looking to help who ever she can and she is truly genuie when doing so. Lisa is a very proud person and those who know her would also know that it takes a lot for her to ask for help, In which most cases she would not. It is because of this that I ask in all of you to help pay for Lisa’s medical expenses and living cost per month so that she can take the proper time neeeded to deal with her disease. Without help Lisa’s chances decline. The funds collected would go towards Lisa’s medication and living cost. This would allow Lisa to take the time off that is needed and relief her of all the added financial stress. No one should have to suffer and work through and illness. Even if you can not help in a monetary way you can always help by leaving Lisa a note of encouragement. I know Lisa would much love that. Please help Lisa fight this terrible disease it could happen to anyone Thank you all

Help Cardi get the medicine she needs,$150 raised,"Hi, my name is Ezekiel and I was fortune enough to be greeted by a beautiful girl looking for help. Cardi walked up to myself and a friend outside my office last Thursday as friendly as could be and just looking for some love. She greeted us with a smile and we were both hooked. She wouldn't dare leave our side once she found us and I volunteered to bring her in to our home to make sure she got the care and love she needed until we are able to find her family. Cardi is chipped, but all of the owner information is out of date and the owners have made no attempt to contact me. She has fit in very well in our house with our other dog Arrietty and cat Charley. She's also fallen in love with our children as much as they have fallen in love with her. Unfortunately, we do not have the room to keep her long-term. Plus, Arrietty is also showing signs of some stress for the fact that she's been the only dog there since she was born and now she has to share everything. Cardi is very well behaved, she spayed, obedient, and already house trained. I have no doubt that she will have an easy time finding a new family, but she does need some help. She has allergies which is common for pit bulls and she has an ear infection. I would really love for the new family who decides to take her in to not have to bear the financial burden of bringing in a new loved one. Anything that you are willing to donate will help Cardi live along and happy life.

Fund for my Dad's ALS medication,"$3,460 raised of $1,000 goal","My dad has ALS, also known as Lou Gerhig's disease. ALS is a progressive, paralytic disease of the nerves and muscles. He has been fighting this horrible disease for three years now, and finally a new drug named Radicava has been approved to treat ALS. This is the first drug approved by the FDA for treatment of ALS in 20 years. It has shown to be so effective during clinical trials that they had to rush it through the approval process to get it out to the public. Although it's not a cure, it can help slow the progression of my dad's ALS and we are so blessed that my dad has  been approved for it.
However, this mediciation is extremely expensive, he recives the medicine every day by IV for two weeks of each month. While insurance covers a small part of the cost, there is still a very heavy financial burden on my family to cover the rest of the cost. With a little bit of help from our friends, family and community we can sufficently raise enough money to help lighten the financial strain and ensure my dad gets his medication.  
My hope is that this medication will slow the progression of this devistating disease and lessen the pain he experiences. It would mean the world to me, my dad and my family if you could keep him in your prayers and hope that one day they will have a cure for ALS. 
for taking the time to read this, any donations will be greatly appreciated.
Another way you can help is by about ALS because many people still do not know about this disease, and the more people who know, the faster we can help to find a cure.

Funeral arrangements for Daisy,"$2,015 raised of $4,000 goal",My daughter recently passed due to drug addiction and it was so sudden we are not financially able to take on this challenge. Always trying to run from her pain and it has taken her down.,"Waukegan, IL"
"Lauren's ""Cancer is Costly"" Fund","$4,845 raised of $4,000 goal","My story:
As most of you know, in 2013 at the age of 26, I was diagnosed with , a rare cancer of the bone marrow and blood. CML is an acquired leukemia, resulting from a change in a person's DNA. This change results in an uncontrolled growth of white blood cells. CML is not a genetic disease, and the cause of the change in DNA is still unknown-- although some researchers believe it is due to exposure of a large dose of radiation at some point in the patient's life. CML is an incurable type of leukemia, with zero chance of a true remission. This means that I will unfortunately have cancer for the rest of my life. 

While my family and I were devastated at this news, we were very grateful to discover that CML could be managed by a form of targeted oral chemotherapy. Prior to 2001, CML patients had a life expectancy of 3-5 years. In 2001, a drug called Gleevac, a , would change the lives of many CML patients, allowing them to live relatively normal lives, with a comparable life expectancy of a healthy individual. Upon returning home after a total of a month's stay in the hospital, I was put on a daily dose of , a stronger and more effective equivalent to Gleevac. In order to live, I will have to take Tasigna for the rest of my life, and even then, at any time, my body can develop a resistance or mutation that would not allow the medication to do its job. If I were to reach that point, the next step would be a bone marrow transplant, which typically results in countless months in the hospital, and a 50/50 survival rate. This very fact scares me to my core, every single day.



While for the most part, being on a TKI has allowed me to live many days even forgetting I am sick, there are a variety of nasty side effects that undoubtedly affect my quality of life, as well as the cost of the drugs- roughly 12k for a monthly supply. Ironically, if I do not take this medication, I will not live. Not much of a choice, huh? :) Luckily, I have been blessed for now to receive help paying for this medication, but this program does not help with any other cancer-related costs. My biggest financial burden, especially as a young woman who just started her ""career"" a year and a half ago, has been the plethora of visits to my oncologist- who although is AMAZING, is very costly. My appointments occur about every 3 months, and even insurance, cost an estimated $1,000 or more per visit, for the many blood tests and routine lab work that has to be done to make sure the cancer is at bay. God-forbid if something major were to happen, or if I were to admitted back to the hospital...... Needless to say, the financial strain that my family and I have endured has been overwhelming- and with my next appointment approaching in February (and the new set of bills it will incur), it feels like we are never going to be able to catch up and breathe. 

The first two years after my diagnosis, I became very active in fundraising for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, raising thousands of dollars and participating in their annual charity walks. Our team, ""Balthrop's Blood Busters"", was one of the top fundraising teams in the Metro Detroit Chapter of LLS. During these two years of actively fundraising, I also applied each year for their Patient Assistance Program; one year being denied because I had a job and health insurance, and the next year being granted $7,500 for help with my medical bills to be told a week later that they were out of available funds for CML patients specifically. Besides LLS, and one other available grant that I was denied for due to already having medical insurance, a financial assistance program or fund for CML patients   After working very hard to raise money in hopes that not only would it help fund new discoveries in blood cancer research, but also help provide patients, like myself, with the financial support they so desperately needed, it was discouraging and angering to find out that assistance for CML patients was non-existent. It was then that I decided to stop fundraising in the traditional form, and take my own approach. 



Cancer isn't cheap- and it truly is sad that not only are we given a life-threatening and incurable disease for the rest of our lives, but are also put into crippling debt just trying to stay alive. I have decided to set up this GoFundMe page in hopes that my dear friends and family can help- in any way you are able. I will post and promote this page once a year, using all funds toward my doctor's bills, medicinal costs, and other cancer-related expenses for the year. This money will also be put aside as a ""safety net"" in case things start going south- such as hospital admittances, bone marrow biopsies, or additional tests needed if my body were to stop responding to my TKI. In addition- I will also be donating of the funds raised to the  - to ensure that we are also taking an active part in the continued research towards finding a cure for all blood cancers! 

I know many of you have asked me ""How can I help?"", or have been wondering if I will be fundraising this year like I have in the past.... THIS is how you can help, because, as my page clearly explains, cancer is extremely COSTLY! Any amount is more than appreciated and such an incredible blessing. Please also feel free to share this page so we can spread the word to others, and of course, say a prayer. :) From the bottom of my heart, I am so thankful for each & every person who has been along-side me in this journey.

As many of you know, I have looked up to her all my life, and in 2015 she was diagnosed with early breast cancer. She bravely underwent a double mastectomy and fought hard during that time. Unfortunately, last week we received the news that she has metastatic breast cancer.

We are all saddened by the news, but we remain hopeful that with the right treatment plan, we can lengthen her life and make every day count. We are grateful for the incredible team of doctors who are working with us to determine the best treatment options for her. This includes Ibrance. A drug she was prescribed by her oncologist, but that unfortunately has a co-pay price of $3500 per month. We are fairly confident that we will have a payment path after this month, but we were not prepared for the initial cost. We are asking for help to cover the first month of Ibrance.

But Shannon is a strong fighter and was not going to give up. She has undergone numerous rounds of Chemo treatments, radiation and new drug trials. However her last scans show even more tumors are in her lymph nodes, lungs, liver and back. There is no cure. The pain she is experiencing is unbearable and now she has lost movement in her left leg. Her husband Jody and daughter Cammie are watching the center of their family fade away. She can’t sleep because of the tumors pressing in her back muscles. With the start of the year, their out of pocket medical costs are high. Prescriptions that might help with pain are too expensive. This family needs us! They need prayers more than ever and they need financial assistance to help take some of the burden and stress off of them. Shannon and I went to high school together but it was over 20 years later that we met again standing in Jason’s yard in Buford. They were neighbors. God puts people in our lives for reasons. We have daughters the same age. But our lives are so different now. She is literally fighting for her life, for more time with her beautiful daughter and more time with the love of her life. My heart breaks when we talk. I wish I could take it all away. All I know to do is listen, pray hard and help relieve some of the financial burden.

In February 2023 I went to spend time with family in New Orleans, I wasn't feeling the best and I didn't know that the antibiotics I was taking would almost kill me. The last thing I remember is I called a cousin and asked him to come and take me to urgent care because I didn't feel good, however, before they could arrive I fell ill and they found me in a diabetic coma in the hotel room. While waiting for emergency services I was told I began having seizures and from there I was rushed to the hospital, where I stayed for nearly three months. During that time I was in a coma, my kidneys shut down completely which caused me to have to undergo dialysis, I was placed on a ventilator, and there were scans and numerous procedures and therapies to keep me alive. I am thankful and grateful for the hospital and my family and all that was done to save my life, but my new normal is taking a toll on me as well. While I am working hard to move forward and live I am still faced with the financial burden from my unexpected hospital stay and the lingering and life long changes resulting from my being sick.

2Pat's Drug Trial Travel Expenses,"$2,640 raised of $5,000 goal","My mom is Patricia Heier, and she has been battling with a re-occurring cancer called Sarcoma since 2008. It has been a long road. She has gone through multiple major surgeries, intensive chemo, radiation, and now multiple drug trials across the country. Right now there is only one drug trial out there that she is a candidate for and might be able to help. Unfortunately, the trial is located in Santa Monica, CA. My mom has to travel there every single week in order to stay in the trial. As you can all imagine this is a very costly undertaking. It is her only option right now, and she has to continue. I have witnessed how this financial burden has become a huge stress. Many of you have already helped out in major ways by donating airline miles, hotels points, etc. and my mom could not be more appreciative. My mom would never ask for a personal donation, and she will probably be upset with me for setting up this page, but I had to give it a try.

There is so much stress that goes along with having cancer, and all I want to do is try to alleviate bit of that stress for my mom. Unfortunately, I am unable to do that alone, so I’m asking my mom’s village to please consider making a donation to keep her in this drug trial. Any donation made to this page will go directly towards flights, and hotels for her weekly trip to California. She will be forever touched and grateful for any small donation sent towards her travel expenses. Thank you all for the love and support you all have shown through the years. I can't even tell you how much it means.

Let's help Matt cover the cost of his Treatment,"$26,347 AUD raised of $20,000 goal","Hi, my name is Sharon and I'm fundraising to help cover the cost of medical expenses for a great guy named Matt King. In all honesty, I have only know Matt for a little over 2 years now, when he came into my good friend Caroline's life and changed it for the better. Whilst I have only known Matt for a relatively short time, It didn't take long for me to see what an amazing, caring, loving and genuine guy he is.

As you may know, Matt has recently been diagnosed with Metastatic Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS), which is an extremely rare cancer. Matt's treatment plan involves Radiotherapy which he is doing privately in order to get treatment quickly, and therefore has out of pocket costs for Matt to pay himself. In addition to radiotherapy, Matt will start on Tecentriq (Atezolizumab) which is an immunotherapy drug that has only recently been approved for use in ASPS patients in America. As it is not approved for Matts type of cancer in Australia, it is not on the PBS schedule and therefore Matt will have to pay the full cost himself, with each vial costing $6747.37 on top of the radiotherapy out of pocket costs.

This is our kind and beautiful daughter Emilia, aged 7, who in June last year was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive brain tumour, known as Diffuse Midline Glioma (DMG).

After several hours Emilia was sent home being told she had gastroenteritis.

A rare, aggressive, incurable glioma, due to its location in the thalamus and brainstem, surgery to remove the tumour is not possible as the tumour is embedded among brain regions essential for life including control of breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure.

Presenting to the emergency department with no concerning symptoms aside from mild concussion following a knock to the head playing local finals footy, a series of images from Dan’s scans showed a large tumour growth and obstructive hydrocephalus. Following a biopsy of the tumour tissue, a VP shunt was inserted in his brain to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid.

In April of 2023, he was like any other curious boundary pushing three year old. He wanted to be a dolphin when he grew up. He was happiest when playing with his brother Ted, making cups of tea in his kitchen and watching old school Scooby Doo and Smurfs. His favourite colour was yellow. Then he came home with a limp.

Three weeks later, four doctors walked into our room to advise us our baby bear had stage IV cancer. Neuroblastoma.
Whilst Jack had been playing, swimming, sleeping, laughing and giving “huggles” his nerves cells had failed to mature properly, resulting in a mandarin sized tumour growing near his adrenal gland and kidney. From there it spread to lymph nodes, bone marrow and his bones, from the top of his beautiful head down to his toes.

Medication and Treatment Help,"$2,050 raised","Hi! My name is Tessa and my spouse and I are in a terrible situation. My spouse is unemployed and I recently lost my job - I had accepted another job and given my two weeks notice. On the last day of my notice, the Friday before I was supposed to start, I got a call that the company had made changes and the position was no longer available. We had already hired my replacement so I was left with nothing. We are both pending eligibility with EDD. We were on the verge of homelessness but we found a temporary place to stay and I am waiting to hear back from housing assistance.

I have many health issues and I am trying to get approved for disability. I have three autoimmune diseases and the two that are most difficult are Type 1 Diabetes and Sjogrens Syndrome. For the past year my symptoms have worsened a lot. The Sjogrens causes inflammation in your joints which is achy and sore. I also suffer from extreme chronic fatigue and nausea. The nausea has gotten so bad that I have barely any appetite, have trouble drinking liquids, and I have also been having vertigo. My rheumatologist referred me to a gastro specialist for later this month to make sure there is not something else, as many of my symptoms align with Celiac Disease. And of course, the more autoimmune diseases you have, the more you will get.

Help my mother get medical treatment,"$552 raised of $20,000 goal","My name is Ashley. I am a 19 year old Zimbabwean. The woman in the photo is my mother, Gaudencia Manjovha. She is 44 years old.

My mother was diagnosed with high blood pressure in 2009. In April 2020, her body started rejecting the medication she had been taking to regulate her blood pressure. Her body started swelling up and she would wake up with a swollen head, face, tongue, legs and stomach. Normal blood pressure is 130/90 or 130/80 but hers is 169/115 when its low and 230/140 at its highest.

As a result of this reaction to the drugs doctors decided to take her off the medication until they could figure out what was causing the swelling. However, the doctors warned us that with her high BP, if she went for a long time with no medication she was at risk of suffering a stroke or a heart attack.

His mental health was declining, our Ty developed symptoms of OCD, Anxiety, Depression, and Suicidal Ideation. As a family we were devastated and with Julia’s nurse background she sprung into action, he was admitted to a mental health facility and started on medication. For months Ty has been in different mental health facilities, multiple medications, outpatient therapy, IOP therapy, he has tried it all. With all these interventions however nothing became better, in fact everything has become worse.
Julia’s mother and nurses intuition decided it was time to look to medical interventions and reasons that this could be happening, it was such an abrupt change in mental health with no forewarning at all, it just didn’t make sense. Which brought them to a clinic in Creston, IA where through lab work and tests he was diagnosed with PANS i.e. Pediatric Acute Onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome. In layman’s terms Ty has inflammation in his brain that is causing his symptoms, at some point in September he had a viral illness and instead of the virus going to his immune system, it went to his brain and is wreaking havoc.

Medication and Treatment for Doña Marina,"$3,019 raised of $5,000 goal","""Have you eaten yet?"" That was a classic question you heard my mother ask anyone if you ever crossed paths with her. Doña Marina (like many people call her) has always been kind to others. 

My mother was always full of energy, and she used that energy to work for her family and help others; everybody. For many years she organized groups of people to serve food to those who didn't have anything to eat. She also collected clothes for those who had nothing to wear. And in extreme cases, she was always there for the ones who were sick. She paid them visits; to people in the hospital she brought them hope, comfort, and prayers; along with medication if they couldn't afford it.  I grew up watching her give, always give. Her calling is, was, to help others.

In the past ten years, things changed. She was left alone to take care of her own sick mother. That job required her to be dedicated full time to one person only. She fed her mother, changed her diapers, gave her mother showers, took her to the doctor, and gave her her medication.  We noticed that my mother was not the same after my grandmother died. Mom was tired. She got sick. 
One doctor diagnosed one thing and another doctor diagnosed another thing. Different doctors found different things going wrong, but nobody gave her a definite diagnose.  Something was wrong, we just didn't know what.

In the last 4 years, her health has deteriorated significantly. She went to see a pulmonologist because she began feeling like she couldn't breathe. Very soon, her walks had to be interrupted by short breaks to catch some air before continuing walking.  Beyond that, things got worse rapidly. Two years ago I went to visit her and she let me take her to see her pulmonologist. The doctor explained that her lungs were not producing enough oxygen, forcing her heart to work extra, and making her heart grow bigger. The diagnosis was given: My mother has Pulmonary Fibrosis. 

Very soon, she began feeling more fatigued every day until one day she just couldn't get off the bed. She has been in this condition for several weeks, dealing with severe pain and gasping for air. 

Because she cannot breathe, she has to have a bunk set up downstairs in her small front room.  My father, who is also disabled, cannot lift her or get her up to the bedroom or even to the restroom any longer.  We need to get her a cot/bed, and its cost is beyond our means.  Even the old bed-pan he tried to help her with broke.  

A doctor has visited her at home, one doctor out of the dozens we tried to contact, and he informed me she is in the last stage of her illness.  My mother can no longer get out of bed.  She has to be fed by others, have her diapers changed by others, and there she has to be, stuck in bed gasping for air.  The doctors have said that she needs pain medications if only to ease her pain and suffering in these trying times.  And if she wants to breathe, she needs oxygen assistance; and in Mexico, that is no cheap thing.  Along with the COVID pandemic, among other things, oxygen is in very short supply; and so, the only way to get her the oxygen she needs is to get her a machine that extracts oxygen from the house's water supply.  This 'oxygen extractor' device is costly however it is the only way my mother will be able to breathe.  

We too here in the USA are poor.  Covid has hit us hard in every way you all reading this know well, and it's all we can do to send a few dollars on the rare occasion we can.   And my Mother's pain medications and her needed oxygen machine are far beyond the means of our family here.  By several thousand dollars. 

We need to provide: Cot, a new bedpan and diapers, pain medication, an oxygen machine, and ideally in-house help for both of my parents, and even food.  **The oxygen machine alone costs a few thousand dollars. 

I myself cannot travel to help them because I myself have Systemic Lupus and thanks to COVID and travel restrictions, I'm stuck with listening to my beloved mother gasp while trying to talk to me over the phone.  My hands are tied.  I know these accommodations will not cure her, but I would like for her to be the most comfortable possible at this point. She doesn't deserve to be in pain until she dies.

Please, if you can find it in your heart to help a great woman who dedicated her life to helping others, giving comfort to others in their time of greatest need, a true servant by every meaning of the title, please help us by donating what all you can.  Every penny counts.  And every prayer counts.

Whether or not you choose to donate and help us, God bless you and know that you all who read this are in our prayers.

We are reaching out as a family for support in raising funds for our mother, Meenakshi’s medical treatment and surgeries in Surrey (BC), Canada.

Our mother has been in the Surrey Memorial hospital in Critical Care Unit since April 21st, 2023.

Treatment Medication,"$2,934 raised of $7,500 goal","and....here we go. So most of you know that 11 years ago I was diagnosed with stage 3b breast cancer, with involved lymph nodes, requiring a radical mastectomy. You may also know that after six months of chemotherapy, everything seemed to return to a ""new"" normal. 
Fast forward three years, and that chemotherapy's side effects kicked in. Leukemia is an unfortunate possibility from the chemotherapy that was given. Leave it to me to be in the group of possibilities. 

So, in 2009, I began a year-long battle for my life. They were unsuccessful in beating the leukemia wiwth chemotherapy only. Thankfully, in 2010, I received what they call a ""7 of 8"" donor match. Basically, since I did not have a full sibling, that was about as close as I could get. What it also meant was I would have a lifetime of little side effects. 

One such side effect is what is called graft versus host disease, or GVHD. What that means is my body constantly fights to figure out if my blood is my own or not. The biggest sufferer is my skin, followed by my eyes, liver, intestines, and mouth. GVHD of the skin is more than the spots, light or dark patches, and dryness that you may visibly see. What it is doing to me is causing the skin to thicken on the inside. This is causing great pain, severe itching, it is pressing on internal organs, intestines, etc. 

Now forward to now. I have found an amazing GVHD-specific doctor here in New York, at Columbia University Medical Center. He presented the treatment option that he believes I need to correct the problem. It combines a new medication, Imbruvica, with a known steroid, Prednisone. It would not be me if there were not a catch. The medication is a tier 5 drug on my insurance formulary, meaning the co-pay is astronomical. Monthly, with insurance, i would have to pay $1,037. Well, I might be a little less stressed if it were that simple. The problem is the six months he anticipates I will need the medication before we see changes in the thickening of the skin, and other issues to begin to return to normal. 

Six months. $1,037 per month. Of course I have to visit the doctor's office every few weeks so he can monitor my health, as this is a new medication. Total out of pocket expenses: approximately $7,500. This includes six months of medication, and 9 office visits. 

He fully expects the treatment to work as it has for several other patients he has seen with similar symptoms as me. The problem is, because of the steroids, and the inability to just stop taking them at will, I have to know for sure i can go the full treatment cycle, or I cannot begin. This is why, after a whole lot of tossing and turning, I decided to turn to this means of asking for help. 

Someone suggested I ask the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, where many donations have been made in my honor. There would normally be a way to do that, except for two things: one, they have exhausted the funding for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) which is the type I had, and two, the medication I am receiving is not normally used to treat AML, but a different leukemia altogether. It has proven to have good results though. 

So with all that said, my often too proud self is throwing this out there. Hoping my faith keeps me going just a little while longer, as I still have quite a few things in this life I hope to do, a few more lives to change, a few more grandbabies to meet..

It's a pretty tight timeline, as I have to let him know very soon if I am going to begin the treatment, so if you could share this too, that would be great. 
Love always, the Diva,
Angela.

Funding for OCD Treatment & Medication,"$2,392 raised of $2,400 goal","First and foremost, I want to thank everyone who has even taken the time out of their day to read, view and share this fundraising campaign.

To those who wish to get to know me better: My name's Reynaldo. I'm currently a full-time 3rd year Music Education Major and a near full time employee at a Texas based fast food chain.

Currently I stay at home with 4 others; My mother, Step-Dad, Older Sister and Younger Sister.  Typically we all work fulltime and have enough funds to support one another in the event of an emergency, but recently our situations changed and we're in a position that we prayed we'd never find ourselves in.

The last month hasn't been very kind to any of us. At the beginning of October I contracted the flu which took me out of work for a little over a week. The following week I was in a fender bender that caused us to go into a week long dispute regarding who was at fault.

But the real salt on the wound was when the entire household contracted Covid.  This happened roughly during mid-October, and just recently this past week (11/9/2020) we've started reintegrating back to our normal lives.

Up until then, we've been unable to work, and income has become scarce which has us starting to rely on our family savings for basic necessities and costs. During this time I started experiencing debilitating intrusive thoughts. For days I had severe insomnia where I could only sleep for 30 minutes at best.

I couldn't bring myself to eat more than half a meal a day without the urge to throw up, and it felt like my mind was constantly looping these intrusive thoughts on repeat. The only relief I would get was by religiously repeating a phrase in my mind without rest (which is still an ongoing struggle). I became mentally exhausted and at times thought that the only way my panic attacks would end is if I wasn't here anymore.

It became so severe that my family decided I'd no longer be allowed to stay in a room alone out of fear I would harm myself.

Eventually I was able to meet with a licensed psychologist this past Thursday (11/12) and after our initial meeting, she diagnosed me with Moderate OCD, Severe General Anxiety Disorder and Mild Depression. The most effective treatment that she determined, would be to undergo a process called Emotional Response Prevention Therapy. 

This is where I begin to need financial assistance and the help of others.

As some of you may or may not know, a significant portion of insurance companies don't include mental health treatments in their coverage. I'm currently in the process of researching potential insurance companies that can help with the costs of therapy. But as of right now I'm not sure I'd be able to find an insurance company to accept me in a timely manner. 

The ERP Treatment process is set to last a total of 9 weeks. 
3 weeks would have 2 sessions, that would total $300 a week. 
6 weeks would have 1 session, that would total $150 a week. 
Roughly totaling: $1,800

The remaining amount of the goal ($600) would go towards covering medication expenses. Currently I've been prescribed 2 different medications. Alprazolam (which is more short term) and Paroxetine (which I'm set to take for an extended time).

As I've mentioned before, up until this week my entire family has had no source of income. Yet even as I return to my job, I make only an estimated $240 per week. It's become impossible to balance my school tuition, billings, daily living expenses and OCD treatment. 

I'm not usually one to reach out for external help.. but this is truthfully something I see no other alternative to. And as much as my family wants to be able to help, there comes a point where we have to be realistic and understand that at this time, there's no conceivable way to pay this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this,
-Reynaldo Almanza

Steph's Medication and Treatment!,"$45,213 CAD raised of $1 goal","A few weeks ago, my sister Steph was diagnosed with a rare and life threatening disorder called severe idiopathic aplastic anemia and complete bone marrow failure. She is receiving chemo and multiple other treatments this week and will be needing a bone marrow transplant, however they are waiting until she is more medically stable to be able to do the transplant. She is currently on diludid (morphine), anti biotics, antivirals, as well as treatment for aplastic anemia. At this stage she has not responded well to therapy.  Steph has always been super active and always a busy body,  now she can only walk as far as her bed to the elevator.  She has a five year old and a two year old and has been unable to leave her hospital bed for weeks now.  It is likely she will remain in hospital another 7 days.  This week alone she has had to recieve 4 platlet transfusions and 2 blood transfusions.  We are anxious every day that she will catch an infection as she is so immunocomprimised. Some of her treatments are not covered by OHIP and are upwards of $10,000 per month. She is looking into various options for this, but so far personal insurance as well as Trillium are not going to cover. Please consider helping my sister and my little niece and nephew in whatever way you can! Thank you so so much in advance. (Also- please consider giving blood! Steph and other patients on her floor are receiving multiple blood and platelet transfusions per week- this can be life saving!)

The following is Steph's story written by her work  colleague, Joanne:


On Feb 16, 2020 I received this message from my friend and colleague, Stephanie Newman who had been unwell with what we thought was strep throat for about 4 days: “Hey Jo. This is very difficult but something has gone very wrong with me.. my bone marrow is essentially failing. I have more follow ups tomorrow. I have a rare infection in my throat and my body has gone into some autoimmune action. I have lost all of my hair in the past 24 hours. I have seen a dermatologist already. Had a lot of blood work. So far they still feel this is in reaction to this infection. However it is likely I will not return to work for a few weeks and when I do I will not have hair. As of right now I may be admitted to hospital tomorrow or may get stay home depending. Currently I don't have a fever so that is good. This is all happened very fast and I don't know the answers at the moment but hopefully I will know more soon. Just an update. I will keep you posted” Here is the update: Stephanie was admitted to the hospital the very next day. After extensive testing, she has been diagnosed with aplastic anemia which is a very serious autoimmune disorder. The source of this is not known at the moment but the doctors have decided to try a certain treatment route with very expensive medications (some not covered by any insurance - private or government). A bone marrow transplant is likely to be needed and family members are being screened this week. Now Steph has two autoimmune disorders - she is also a diabetic; she was diagnosed at the age of 6.  The majority of her diabetic medication isn’t covered either. The medications she will be required to take are very expensive and one is $12,000 a month. We are waiting to see if this can be covered. It has not been covered in the past for other patients. Steph and Mike have two young children. The youngest is in daycare. Steph is not entitled to short term sick benefits from her job, is awaiting approval for EI At this time, it is not known how long she will be hospitalized and it is likely she will be unable to work for a year. Mike may need to take a leave from his job as an elementary school teacher and with all these strikes his wage is now diminished. Now with all the medication expenses, parking, daycare and everyday living expenses, this young family is in need of help. Please donate what you can to give them a fighting chance. They are a lovely, hardworking family with two beautiful young children.

From Christine:
Steph works as a scientist at Western University, as well as a chemistry prof at Brescia and an Immunology prof at Fanshawe. Even today in the hospital she was trying to finish incomplete marking to help her students ease into the transition of a new instructor.   Steph has had tons of support and visitors and this has been so amazing! As we follow this illness through for the next 6 to 9 months as a family we appreciate any and all help- including those who have already come to clean, cook, babysit, and visit! Steph and Mike send love to everyone they know who have messaged and supported them. They are very humbled.

From Steph and Mike:
Thank you to all of our family, friends, friends of family, etc who have donated, called us, babysat, cooked, everything.  We want everyone to know that any of this that is not used directly to support our required living cost or treatment will be donated back to the hematology unit or bone marrow drive in Ontario.  Just recently, we saw a story of a man in the USA who was 28 and could not find a bone marrow done for his aplastic anemia. This man was given cord blood instead after not responding to treatment. Sadly, this procedure did not go well and he ended up loosing his battle.  The importance of this is to stress that if financial help is not possible, you can still help the cause! Donating blood, platlets, or joining the bone marrow registry could help me and many many others here! So far I have recieved platelets 6 times and had 2 blood transfusions in 14 days.  Anything like this is so important.   Again we cannot thank you enough. When I have more energy we will send out many thank you cards, likely all including a personalized art piece by Poppy or Henry.  We are all in this together, and we feel that all of you are with us.  Mike and I are so touched and greatful for both your support, but also your time.   I will post updates as often as possible if you wish to follow along.  Steph

From Gary and Nancy (Steph's parents)- March 4th
Dear family and friends, from the bottom of our hearts, thank you for your kindness, support and generosity. The number of people who have offered their support to our daughter Stephanie, our son-in-law Mike, and our grandchildren, Poppy and Henry is simply amazing. We are grateful for all of you.

Medical treatment for Peabee,$280 CAD raised of $280 goal,"I’m raising money to help cover the costs of my wonderful cockatiel Peabee. A few months ago Peabee fell i’ll with an infection which we have been working very hard with our avian vet to clear. unfortunately the medications she has been on has not helped her, so we have been cycling through different antibiotics and antifungals to help. She is currently on three different medications which are unfortunately quite costly, and i have had to take out savings from my university fund for nursing to help Peabee out. So far her treatment has costed a little over $1000.

At this rate, my vet is suggesting some more in depth testing that i currently cannot afford in order to take a deep look at her blood work and organ function since her infection has been getting worse without any relief. It is suspected to be something more than a simple infection, such as an underlying chronic illness, but without testing we will not know for sure. I only want what’s best for her, so i’m hoping with some help with funds, the avian team i have been working with can help get to the bottom of this and get her the treatment she needs to restore her health.

Dan, previously, before his diagnosis, was a keen footballer and played for Newark Town FC as their goalie.

Medical treatment for Snuggles,$370 raised,"My name is Scott Johnson. My daughter has a wonderful little dachshund mix pup named Snuggles. Snuggles is not an old dog but he recently developed a debilitating back ailment called Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD). IVDD is a very serious and painful condition affecting a dog's spine.

Medication for inpatient treatment,$210 raised of $250 goal,"Hello my name is Ben Pyatt. I am a long time addict, and have multiple mental health issues. I have decided that I will not longer live under control of my addictions. So I have decided that this Wednesday, I am going into a dual diagnosis treatment facility. The program will be paid for by a government grant, which I have already been approved for. Unfortunately, my mental health only acts to stimulate my addiction. Which is why I have chosen a dual diagnosis facility. While the grant will pay for the services and stay at the facility. I have to bring my own toiletries, laundry detergent, and other necessities. I don't like asking for help, or handouts. Truthfully, this is beyond my control, because at this moment in time, I honestly don't know that I will survive another two months without taking this step.

Help CF Patients Access Medication in Canada,"$20,412 CAD raised of $50,000 goal","Canada needs life-saving cystic fibrosis medications. And we need your help to make it happen.

For more than five years the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Treatment Society has been relentlessly advocating with governments across Canada to get CF patients access to the life-saving medicines known as gene modulators. These medications include Kalydeco, Orkambi, Symdeco and Trikafta.

Cries for help have largely fallen on deaf ears in provincial capitals and our nation's capital. CF patients, whose lives can be transformed through these medicines, face declining health and ultimately death as they continue to be denied access to the medications. .

We can’t wait any longer. If governments choose to ignore the moral, ethical and medical imperatives to act, we’ll fight to make access a legal requirement.

That’s why the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Treatment Society has launched a class action lawsuit against the British Columbia Provincial Government, the Federal Government, Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) and the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance (pCPA) and also has been granted intervenor status in another lawsuit against the Government of Canada, challenging its jurisdiction to make the Regulatory Amendments to the legislation that governs the Patented Medicine Pricing Review Board (PMPRB) in Quebec.

It’s a basic human right for governments to provide access to life-sustaining medications and, with your help, we’re going to make them deliver on this commitment. Breathing is a right.

We urgently need funding to keep these legal actions going. With your support we’ll ensure CF patients across Canada achieve unrestricted access to these transformative medicines so they can lead full and productive lives.

Thank you for joining our fight.



The Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Treatment Society is a registered not-for-profit organization. Founded by Chris MacLeod in 2014, we have been fighting tirelessly to get CF patients access to life-saving medicines. We are entirely volunteer run and 100 percent of the funds we raise go directly to our advocacy initiatives. Please visit our website to learn more about us.

Help Hillary pay for life-saving medication,"$3,005 raised of $3,000 goal","Hi, my name is Kimberly Nicholson and I am trying to raise money to help my friend Hillary Lassiter pay an outstanding copayment for a life-saving medication so she can continue her lupus treatment.

My friend Hillary has lupus that will not go into remission. When not controlled with medications, it attacks her heart and other primary organs. Every lupus case is different and hers is life threatening when not under control. My earliest memories of Hillary were of her fighting Pericarditis, a severe infection of the sac surrounding the heart. Since then I have watched Hillary bounce through a variety of doctors who have tried many treatments to control her lupus without success. Her most recent medication prescribed in September is Cytoxin, which is a weekly chemotherapy infusion treatment. The health insurance initially denied coverage as it is primarily used for treatment of breast cancer. After much back and forth, the insurance stated they would cover the Cytoxin for treatment of her lupus if Hillary administered the weekly injections at home forgoing the typical office visit involved with each treatment. Hillary proceeded with this plan, but after a couple of injections received a bill from the specialty pharmacy for a little over $10,000, which she did not have. At this point the pharmacy refused to fill additional prescriptions and Hillary was forced to discontinue her treatment. For months she has been at the mercy of the pharmacy and insurance company. The final resolution, with the help of a copay assistance program, was reduction of the outstanding medication copayment from $10,000 to $2,400. The pharmacy will not allow a payment plan. Hillary must clear the outstanding balance and be prepared to pay copayments moving forward in order to obtain the needed chemotherapy medication.

Rare disease medical treatment - Help needed,"$78,401 raised of $78,000 goal","Hi, my name is Wendy. I was impacted by a tech layoff. Sadly, many of you are well aware of the layoffs in tech as well. The market has been far from kind - if you are very senior or very junior it's been even more difficult. As someone very senior, I've been passed up repeatedly due to the amount of experience.

While we have done our best to manage finances, and to keep a positive attitude - I need your help. Today I found out that the medication I require to manage a rare immunodeficiency disease requires all new approval processes due to a change in insurance. These process requires series of tests, specialists, time and doctors to advocate. Its a long process normally taking months. This means we have to pay out of pocket for treatments - as this is immunoglobulin it is extremely, extremely expensive.

Odin’s Medical Treatment,"$1,780 raised","My name is Chris, but this fundraiser is not for me. It is for my amazing boy Odin in the picture. He has been my protector, my emotional support, and my rock since he was 6 weeks old when I got him. Odin has been with me every day all day since I got him and has not only protected me from aggressive people but also helps calm me if I begin having a panic attack from my anxiety. He has saved me in so many ways, and now it’s my turn to save him. A week ago he started acting very lethargic and like he wasn’t well. I called the vet and got him an appointment scheduled as soon as they could see him. They couldn’t find anything notably wrong with him so they gave him some medication to see if it would help. Unfortunately after about an hour Odin had a major seizure. We rushed him back to the vet and they hospitalized him for a few hours and then called to tell me that he needed to go to a neurologist. I then drove an hour and half to the Texas A&M Small Animal hospital where he was admitted right away for 24hrs where they started him on a treatment of anti-epileptic medication and steroids. I was able to take him home the next morning and he did fairly well. He was eating, drinking, and going to the bathroom pretty well until yesterday where he ended up having 5 cluster seizures(small seizures) throughout the day. He woke me up at 6am this morning(10/21) panting and can’t stop circling to the right when he walks. We rushed him to the animal hospital where they admitted him again for more treatments and to monitor him. He really needs an mri so we can figure out what the proper treatment he needs is and what is actually going on and what is happening. I have spent everything I have so far on him and it wasn’t enough. The mri estimate I got is $5000 and that is what brings me here. I cannot give up on this amazing man after all he has done for me. I am now desperately asking for help. Please help me save him.

Life saving medical treatment for Rosa,"$2,080 raised of $2,000 goal","Rosa is the love of my life and means the world to me. She was recently diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, a not uncommon ailment in older cats that left untreated can quickly lead to serious medical problems, most often death from heart failure. Fortunately, it is treatable. Unfortunately, the easiest treatment option--twice daily medication--isn't suitable for her as she is highly adverse to taking pills. However, the best option--treatment with radioactive iodine (see link below for explanation of how it works, if you're curious)--is not only a good option for her, it's the gold standard for feline hyperthyroidism and is fortunately available in Columbia, where we live. It is VERY expensive however. My vet, who is wonderful and supportive and knows Rosa's medical history very well, says that ""I would absolutely recommend this therapy for her!"" With the exception of hyperthyroidism, Rosa is in excellent health and otherwise should have many years left.

Rosa spent the first eight years of her life living in a feral colony before coming to live with me in 2015. However, she's about the sweetest and most affectionate cat I've ever known and damn smart as well. Somehow, she recognizes when I'm sad and responds with extra attention and affection: head butts, purring, kneading--all those things cats do to show their love and caring. She's truly a one in a million cat and I would do anything to keep her healthy and happy as long as possible, even begging my friends and family for the financial support necessary to do so.

:

If you read the treatment explanation from the University of Missouri Veterinary Hospital linked below, you'll see the cost  for the treatment range from $1,500-$1,800. I believe the range varies depending on how long she will have to remain in isolation (because they are treated with radioactive iodine, all pets having this therapy are quarantined in isolation and tested daily for radioactive levels and not released until the levels fall to what are deemed safe--a period of time typically between 5-7 days). In addition, I have already spent $363 for two intensive visits with various diagnostic tests to determine and then confirm her diagnosis.

I absolutely HATE having to ask assistance for this, but the truth is that I have no ability to cover this cost on my own, not even a significant minority of it. I have four other cats, two of whom are slowly succumbing to chronic kidney disease and the cost of their care--even with some assistance from friends--is already a very hard financial burden. I live on a very small, fixed income that hardly meets my own needs; I'm not exaggerating when I say that I spend more per month on my cats than I do on myself.

:

Rosa is scheduled for treatment on February 3rd. She will be released about five to seven days later, once her radioactivity levels are deemed low enough to be safe. One half of the cost for treatment is due the 3rd and the remaining cost is due the day of release.

Here's Rosa hanging out with her good buddy, Shadow:


This explains what the treatment is, how much it costs, and what all it entails:


Thank you for reading this and for considering helping Rosa. Many hands make light work and I hope that instead of fewer people making larger donations that many people will make small donations. If you care about me or if you just care about great cats, I hope you will donate. If you cannot afford to do so, I hope you will share this with others.

Thank you again,

Kevin and Rosa (and Shadow, Peter, Moonshine, and Lexi)

You can click here to watch Evie's story , or read below:


In 2013/14 Evie suddenly became very anxious and withdrawn. This was diagnosed as social anxiety and later, depression. Within a year Evie was throwing away her lunch at school, hiding in the library, hurting herself and wasn't the bubbly girl we all knew. We eventually had to pull her out of school. In 2016 came the second wave, she became delusional and extremely paranoid. Evie didn't believe I was her mum, and believed there were 'wanted' posters on lamp posts with her picture on, and she was being searched for by 'bad guys'. This was all very out of character and we struggled to keep Evie safe. I didn't recognise her. Hallucinations, imaginary friends, it was endless. The same year, her seizures started. Seizures are one of Evie's biggest struggles and always have been. She has had thousands. They are very debilitating and difficult for all of us. Following this in 2018 her mobility began to deteriorate. Evie lost full function of her legs for a month, then had periods of paralysis in her arms, and sometimes from the neck down. This was still put down to her 'mental health.' Dystonia is another one of Evie's main symptoms (involuntary muscle contractions, often painful and unnatural positions) this can affect her hands, wrists, fingers, ankles and toes.

Kai’s I.M.H.A Treatment and Medication,"$1,230 raised of $7,000 goal","Hi guys, back in March of this year (2023) Kai was not feeling well…she had stopped eating, she wasn’t playing with her sister and she eventually got to the point where she would not get out of bed. I was admittedly anxious on the car ride to the vets office, Kai is my first dog but little did I know my world was about to be turned upside down. The initial exam showed that Kai was extremely anemic and the vets office did not have the equipment to handle that serious of a condition, we were transferred to Blue Pearl Clearwater and they ran comprehensive test to determine what could be causing her condition. Finally after being transferred to a Critical Care Unit at Blue Pearl Tampa, we knew what was wrong with her, she had Immune Mediated Hemolytic Anemia or (I.M.H.A) . It’s an extremely deadly and serious condition that causes her body to destroy her red blood cells as if they are cancer cells. Luckily Dr. Amanda Burke was on Kai’s case and she was the foremost expert on I.M.H.A, and after 7 long days in the Critical Care Unit and tens of thousands dollars she responded to the medication and she started recovering! Now Kai is sick again and we need help paying for her testing and medication, they think she has some type of infection or she is having another immune response. She has come this far and overcome great odds since her diagnosis, I don’t want to give up on my baby so i’m asking if you would please donate, I will include a full estimate that includes pricing and itemization of materials. She has so much life left in her please consider donating and making a difference for her.

We are Abbey & Sam, and we are fundraising so we can get our cat August the appropriate care she needs to diagnose + treat her illness. August, our 7 year old Calico kitty has been acting unlike herself. She has been not eating, sleeping, vomiting, and has been lethargic the past week or so and it is very concerning.

We were able to take her to the emergency vet yesterday (1/6/23) thanks to generous donations who gave her anti-nauseous medicine, fluids, and pain medication for the mean time. This alone cost about $500. But, she needs blood work, testing and x-rays to determine the cause of what’s making her feel ill. We were given an estimate of 1100+ just for all of the testing, and we didn’t have the money in the moment to get it done. As you all know, vet bills are extremely expensive as we don’t have pet insurance, so this came to a huge shock to us.

Provide comfort & medical treatment for Cinder,"$360 AUD raised of $10,000 goal","My name is Stacia and just over a year ago I was blessed to have Cinder enter my life, and now devastatingly am facing losing her due to large cell lymphoma.

Our incredible veterinary team are doing what they can to work through treatment options but the situatation is grim. Right now my main focus is to make her as comfortable and pain free as possible which involves medication, oxygen treatment, and potentially further fluid drainage due to her pleural effusion.

My birthday is March 21st, the day I'm writing this, and my only wish is to support her. If you can offer any support it is greatly appreciated.

Help Fund Life Saving Medication for Gabriela,"$36,490 CAD raised","As Canadians, we assume that should the worst happen and we receive a cancer diagnosis, we can receive treatment without fear of financial ruin. For a very special woman and dear friend, this is not the case. She is faced with an impossible choice. Cutting-edge treatment at an incredible financial ruin.
Gabriela was originally diagnosed with Breast Cancer in 2013. After treatment, everything was looking up, until the dreaded news “You have Cancer” was once again delivered to her in 2021.
Gabriela has fought the fight with vigour and a positive attitude, determined to watch her son get married and start his own family. The news that her previous treatment stopped working devastated Gabriela and her family, but she did not give up. Her doctor has suggested a drug called ENHERTU. It is a brand-new treatment that has been approved for use in Canada but has only been funded in BC and Quebec. It is made by AstraZeneca and costs $8000.00 every three weeks. This treatment will keep this young vivacious lady alive by IV injection every three weeks. The problem is that AstraZeneca only covers 20% of the cost. Gabriela and her family would have to come up with $6,400.00 every three weeks.

Medical Treatment,"$3,615 raised of $12,000 goal","My world turned upside down after losing my oldest sister to cancer at the age of 33 in May 2010. I suppressed my feelings and did all I could to take care of her in her last few months on hospice. Shortly after, my health became challenged, I had a sinus infection in October 2010. I had some testing in 2011 because I lost my sense of smell and taste. By late November test revealed a large pituitary tumor and it was on the verge of taking my vision. I had surgery on Dec 16, 2011 and was released the day before Christmas only to end up in ICU the next day because I was completely paralyzed on my left side. They originally thought I was just weak from having the brain surgery. They then begin to  think I had a stroke due to the brain surgery. After several visits thru the MRI machine they determined it was not related to the brain surgery but they couldn't give me a reason. I was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital for 2 months. No answers but I was able regain some of my movement on the left side and was able to finally return home to my 2 kiddos. I was diagnosed with Sjogren's Syndrome and Fibromyalgia. After 1.5 years of intense home and outpatient therapy and was able to return to work. Shortly after returning I found out the tumor returned just as aggressive in size. I repeated the brain surgery followed by intense radiation in April 2014. This time I did not have any major setbacks and went back to work within 4 months. I kept searching for answers to this crazy and unheard of illness.  The problem with the diagnosis is my symptoms are not the classic symptoms. My whole left side is constantly in pain from head to toe and the severity never drops below a 7 on a pain scale. Beside the constant pain I deal with weakness, brain fog/memory loss, blurred vision, nausea, nerve damage, headaches and flares. The flares are severe inflammation that cause pain of 10+ with paralysis on the left side only. It mimics a stroke and I end up hospitalized until they rule it out. I never know how long it will last or what each day brings as far as symptoms. Some days I can be bedridden, on a cane, walker or wheelchair. I have had multiple surgeries since 2012 because the inflammation attacks my organs and I end up losing it. Thyroid, partial hysterectomy, gall bladder, appendix, disc replacement to name a few. I had the gastric sleeve done because the constant use if steriods caused me to gain excessive weight. I lost over 100 lbs and it made things better for about 2 years until my health began to decline due to unexplained balance issues and the constant flares. I have traveled to BSW in Killeen, UT Southwestern in Dallas, John Hopkins in Baltimore and Mayo Clinic in Phoenix for answers and no one had answers or a solution. I've tried several different medications, infusions, diets, herbal supplements, natural remedies and foods, including surgeries with no luck. I do aqua therapy 1-2x's a year just to keep my body moving and sometimes I can't get through a full 45 minute session due to the pain and nausea. My pain has gotten worse and since August I have to depend on pain medication to keep my blood pressure under control. My independence has been challenged in all areas during the last 2 years and I have not been able to work full-time. I tried part-time and was only able to make it 6 months before having to be taken off completely. Because the pain has been so bad I've been home bound with no social life during these past 2 years. My doctor's have exhausted all the traditional treatment options that insurance will cover. My desperation has me researching non-traditional options that have to be paid out of pocket. I am asking for your help in covering some if not all of my next phase in treatments. I have already had my consultation visit and have had trial testing to see if my body will respond. I was instructed not to take my pain medication so they were able to see if the treatment would work. My pain level prior to treatment was an 8. I can honestly say that I was able to see a difference in my pain levels. At one point during the treatment I felt little to no pain. My body would already be in severe pain due to not having my medication on time and the length of time I was behind on taking it. I'm very optimistic and looking forward to being independent again. This next phase will consist of 24 treatments over a 12 week span with multiple forms of therapy: PEMF therapy,  Deep muscle therapy, Neurolight therapy, Class IV laser therapy coupled with a plant based diet.  This is a huge step for me to ask for help but this journey has humbled me and I understand I can't do it alone. I've tried several times and ended up stressed and in more pain. Thank you for your prayers and words of encouragement during this medical journey. I'm so ready to live again. Forever grateful and taking nothing for granted! Ebony

Help Craig pay for Cancer Treatment/Medication,"$6,500 raised of $30,000 goal","Craig's story:
Craig is a hardworking husband and father of three who has been diagnosed with kidney cancer for the second time. 3 years ago was his first diagnoses, and had surgery to cut out the mass in his kidney. A few months back, they discovered that the mass in his kidney had returned. After some searching and biopsies, it was discovered that the cancer had spread to his lung and GE junction. Because of the spreading, he was diagnosed with Stage 4 Renal Cell Carcinoma. He will be starting chemotherapy on October 16th, 2019 (his birthday). His insurance does not cover all of the medication costs that he will be receiving, nor will it cover portions of the hospital bills, the 6 hour round-trip journeys to the Twin Cities for his appointments, or the hotel rooms. 

We, his family, will be forever grateful for any contribution that is made during this hard time. He is truly a rock in our lives and is so important to us.

Medical Treatment for Astrid Thorvardsdottir,"$2,755 raised of $10,000 goal","Hello, everyone. I’m here to ask that you give the gift of life and hope to our dear friend, Cindy Ward aka Astrid Thorvardsdottir. She urgently needs our help and every contribution will be a blessing.

After several years of declining health, Cindy received a diagnosis of Castleman’s Disease and POEMS syndrome. A specialist at Emory Hospital has a six-month medication treatment that he says should have her running at the end of treatment. And, of course, the medications are extremely expensive. The system and health-boosting drugs alone will be $3100 a month out-of-pocket after insurance pays its meager share. This is on top of the cost of the drugs to treat Castleman’s Disease and POEMS. The total monthly cost is estimated at $17K. Cindy needs our help to get this treatment started while the paperwork and approvals for grants and financial aid are being processed.

Help to get Mick medical treatment needed in USA,"£9,110 raised of £70,000 goal","Firstly can I thank you all for taking time to read our story, I know it's a massive ask and I cannot believe I’m having to ask others for financial help to get medical treatment that my husband Mick requires to be cured from the potential life threatening illness but unfortunately we are in a situation where there is no one in the uk that has the knowledge nor the expertise to deal with his rare and complex illness so we are looking to gain private treatment further afield however this comes at massive cost.

Mick's illness journey started back in 2019 with recurrent bouts of cellulitis which were treated in hospital with IV antibiotics however over time his condition developed into a chylothorax (a rare but serious condition in which lymph formed in the digestive system (chyle) accumulates in chest cavity/ pleural space), this effected his breathing and needed hospitalised for chest drains to reduce fluid then had a Indwelling Pleural Catheter inserted so this could be done by myself at home.

Ejup Zymberi- medical treatment,"$4,540 AUD raised of $13,000 goal","My father Ejup Zymberi is a 69 year old who has never had an injection / medication in his life until September 2016 where he needed to have a spinal surgery on his neck after losing movement on his left arm . 

Surgery was done beginning of September 2016 ... we were so excited that after the surgery the feeling on his arm started coming back.
I went overseas to see him after his surgery , he was so pumped and happy about the recovery when started lifting without dropping things with his left hand .
He kept saying look at this , look at this - every time he grabbed something with that hand . 

After the surgery he kept complaining that he couldn’t swallow but we all thought it was too soon after the surgery and he should give it some time before he feels better.
All was good until the morning of 2 February 2017 when I woke up to the news that a tumour on his throat was found .
My world just stopped. 
I went to work that morning shaking like a leaf. 
I was numb.
I couldn’t even think. 
The only thing that kept me going was the fact that we didn't know what type of tumour it was for sure  and we will only know more once the biopsy is done.
The biopsy day came .
The surgeon going to perform the biopsy finds out about my father’s recent surgery he orders an MRI to check the neck / discs to make sure that all is good as throat biopsy is pretty invasive procedure.

The MRI result shows that the previous surgery done was in fact just a superficial one and the problems my father had with his nerves /discs were not fixed.

We were told they will not be able to perform the biopsy or any other procedure on the tumour without having another spinal surgery otherwise he will end up paralysed.

We have been reffered to a well known surgeon for the spinal surgery in Zagreb ( Croatia ) and  will cost between 8-9 thousand Euro ( 12-13 thousand Australian dollars ) .

Anyone that knows my dad has been shocked and left speechless  at the news of his health issues . 

This just shows how loved and respected he is among the people that know him .
He cries at the news of strangers going through rough patch .
He has a heart of gold . 

You can call him in the middle of the night no matter what the issue is and he would be happy to help no questions asked  .
For him to go through so much right now is just so unfair ....
I ask all my friends and family to please help me raise the money we need to get him the surgery he needs  urgently so we can than attack the tumour that is scaring the life out of everyone that knows him . 

If you are able to donate anything at all we really appreciate it. 
My dad would drop everything to help others his whole life and it's now his turn to sit back and accept help from others .

From the bottom of my heart I thank everyone that takes the time to read this and is able to help .

Medical Treatment For Michael Conover,"$3,085 raised of $20,000 goal","Dear friends, family, and kindhearted strangers,

This is not easy for our family, but we are in desperate need of your help and don’t know where else to turn. Please know that took A LOT for us to post. Haley has taken pride in how far they have come in life, and they don’t like to give up or admit defeat, but we feel like we are at the end of our rope. We have seen other people successfully gain assistance in times of need and we are praying for a miracle. We need help.

Story:
As many of you know, Michael has recently undergone numerous surgeries to correct a broken collarbone. This has resulted him being unable to work or function regularly since April which has resulted in a significant loss of wages. After the first surgery, he developed MRSA. Since, May he’s been on antibiotics, which haven’t been working. He has had multiple I&D surgeries and has had to have a portion of his collar bone cut off so his incision would hopefully close, which it still hasn’t. Sparing you all of the nasty details, At this point there has already been over $10,000 in medical bills for surgery co-insurances and doctors visits and now between getting the picc line, the antibiotics, and copay we cannot even start his treatment and get a picc line. (Yes! This is WITH insurance.) On top of all of this, when Haley gets home from working full time, essentially as the sole financial support for their household, she takes over (happily) caring for their children since they cannot afford to place their daughter in daycare on one salary, household duties (because life doesn’t stop, right?), cooks dinner, finds time to do her college assignments (before all of this she enrolled full time in college) AND having an 8th grader in Football, meaning games & practice. Moms (& Dads), you can relate, there isn’t enough time in the day!

Emergency Dental and Medical Treatment,"$1,642 raised of $5,000 goal","Hello, my name is Rosie, and I am a disabled parent to an amazing seven-year-old. I am currently without healthcare coverage, and I am having medical and dental emergency needs that are out of reach but essential to my life. Due to my illnesses and medications, I have experienced rapid tooth and jaw decay. This has nothing to do with dental hygiene, and two dental surgeons have confirmed that I need emergency work immediately, as my teeth are rapidly crumbling in my mouth, and my jaw is wasting away. I am unable to eat all solid foods, and due to the nature of some of my disabilities, meal-replacement drinks are not an option for me. I have tried calling dental clinics, but most of them have a wait list of 8-14 months to see anyone. But even if I could get an appointment tomorrow, my Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome depletes my collagen and slows my healing, making it very risky to operate on me, so I can only see very specialized oral surgeons who do not work at these clinics. On top of the dental emergency, I am unable to pay for my medications out of pocket or see any doctors to request refills, and they are refusing to refill them without an appointment. So I have run out of migraine and heart medication, as well as crucial medications that help me eat the only thing I am able to eat: soup. Without my medications, I have started having frequent seizures and heart palpitations that need to be discussed with a doctor urgently. My hope is to raise money to get lifesaving care. I have already had the initial dental X-rays and appointments with two surgeons, but they told me I need an MRI and surgery immediately. The MRI will show the extent of bone grafting I need on my jaw, which will likely be much more than the X‑rays showed, so there's a good chance both the scope of the work and the cost will balloon. If there are enough funds after the dental surgery, I will use them to see the doctor and, at minimum, get my medications filled. I hope to be able to get scans to follow up on my seizures and heart issues. My partner recently lost his job, and we are both working very hard on finding him employment and getting me health coverage, but these things cannot wait for that. We are so grateful for any help to get us through a really rough patch in life right now.

Life Saving Medical Treatment,"$13,135 raised of $20,000 goal","My name is Sherry along with my other sister Michelle and with the help of a friend, We started this Go Fund Me to help our Sister, Jill Pasqualone.
Jill lives in Smithtown with her husband Bobby, a retired police officer and her beloved daughters Kyra and Geri.
It was very challenging to convince Jill to allow us to reach out for help on her behalf. Jill is a woman of great pride and integrity, with a heart of pure gold. 

Jill was diagnosed with Crohn’s Disease in 1999.

Crohn’s Disease is an inflammatory autoimmune Bowl disease that can cause abscesses that can affect any part of the Gastro –intestinal track from the mouth to Anus.

At the time of the diagnoses Jill’s affected area was in her Ilium, which is part of the small intestines that controls one’s ability to absorb all nutrients.
For many years Jill’s condition was under control with  the help of high doses of steroids. In August of 2016, an abscess that developed in Jill's intestines burst. She was rushed to the hospital where an emergency operation was performed in an attempt to drain the abscess and stabilize her.

From that moment on, Jill and her family’s lives would be forever changed.
Over the past 2 years Jill has been in and out of Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan, fighting for her life. She's undergone countless medical procedures to battle the effects of malnutrition, dehydration and septicemia. She's survived 17 surgeries, including the removal of her Colon that left her with a permanent ostomy bag and only 5 feet of intestines.

Jill is currently on a Chemotherapy based medication treatment plan. This treatment is the only thing keeping her alive.
Without it, Jill will die. 

In 2017, overwhelming medical bills totaling in the hundreds of thousands, Jill and Bobby were forced to file for bankruptcy. 
And recently, Jill lost her home- the only home her daughters know due to foreclosure. 

Just a month into Chemotherapy, Jill began receiving bills from her healthcare providers. That's when she learned that she hit her plan limits. Her insurance company will no longer pay for her Chemotherapy treatments. We immediately reached out to her team of doctors for other treatment options, but due to the nature of this disease, Jill's options are few and without insurance to help offset the cost, all will be financially unmanagable. 
As of today, Jill and Bobby are responsible for the cost of all tangeble medical supplies and all of her treatment costs.

In total, Jill and her devoted husband Bobby have been desperately trying  to pay over $2,000.00 each month for Jill to stay alive. They've exhausted all financial options- they have nothing left. 

The situation is dire and we are desperate. Our family urgently needs financial help to offset the insurmountable costs that we need for our sister's survival. 

Your support will immediately help Jill continue to undergo her Chemotherapy treatment and will help with the cost of her neccessary medial supplies she needs for her Crohn's disease symptoms.

Any amount will go a long way for Jill and her family. 

Jill is to young to lose this battle and Kyra and Geri are to young to lose their Mommy.

On behalf of our entire Family and
with a humbling we Thank You in advance

Please help to fund Lucas's ongoing treatment,"£47,327 raised of £100,000 goal","Many of you who have donated or shared Lucas’s plight will know that initially when he was diagnosed with terminal cancer we were given no hope of recovery and therefore raised money to help us allow Lucas to enjoy life to the full in his short time left with us.

Following publicity from our original GoFundMe requests, we were offered a revolutionary new treatment currently being trialled in America. 

On Monday 13th June we were informed by those conducting the trials in Washington DC that unfortunately, due to the length of Lucas’s radiotherapy treatment, he would no longer be accepted for the groundbreaking treatment offered by the National Children’s Hospital in Washington DC. 

Those of you who have followed Lucas’s story from the beginning will recall a second option of drug treatment, not available within the UK but currently being trialled in Germany. This involves two drugs known as ONC201 and ONC206. In addition to a consultation fee, there will be an ongoing monthly drug cost of around £4,000 together with associated living and care costs which will continue until he either goes into remission or the doctors think the cancer has died. 

After speaking at length with the German Consultant he has agreed to supply the necessary medication and monitor Lucas’s progress. It is anticipated that Lucas will begin this medication imminently. 

We have been recommended to put Lucas on a new food supplement, available from America. This product has been proven to help fight and even reduce the spread of cancer. The first batch has been ordered and the ongoing cost of this supplement alone is £300 per week.

We will therefore continue in our efforts to raise money to fund his ongoing treatment.

Therapy and medication for Sara,"$5,285 raised of $15,000 goal","My beautiful daughter Sara has had a typical normal healthy life, until January of this year, when she began getting some intense, inexplicable pain in her hands and feet. The symptoms were worse at night, and eased up in the day, then got more and more frequent to the point of being pretty much constant. She has been completely debilitated, unable to use her hands and often unable to walk due to the pain in her feet. We have sought the assistance of many doctors here in Austin, underwent multiple tests, all coming back negative.  After 2 ER visits and multiple referrals here in Austin, we ended up seeking care in Plano, where Sara was hospitalized for a week as the symptoms progressed. The team of doctors have finally figured out what is wrong, and it is a triple whammy of Small Fiber Peripheral Neuropathy, Erythromelalgia, and Guillain-Barre Syndrome.  Since none of the symptoms were presented in the typical fashion, and add in the complication of the presence of all three,  this was why it took so long to get a diagnosis.

Help Dennis With Costly & Life Changing Medication,"$2,625 raised of $3,000 goal","Dear Family and Friends,

We are reaching out to you for consideration of a donation for Dennis’s much needed, but extremely expensive antibiotics.

Dennis has been prescribed antibiotics that ALL insurance companies refuse to cover. This is because the medication is extremely costly, with just one course running over $3,000!

We have exhausted all efforts of petitioning Dennis’s insurance company to cover this necessary medication. Dennis’s physician has also tried her hardest to get the insurance company to pay for this prescription, but the insurance company will not budge.

Dennis has put himself through much suffering by trying alternative methods to cure his rare condition that involves bacteria colonizing in his body where they should not normally exist. He has had numerous scans and lab tests, just to get to this point.

These antibiotics could be the cure he has been needing desperately, for so long. The life changing antibiotics could resolve many issues caused by the condition, including pain. It would make a drastic difference in his life to get relief from this condition, by obtaining these antibiotics.

We would typically not ask for donations, but unfortunately greedy insurance companies will not even cover a penny of this price gouging prescription drug.

This condition has interrupted Dennis’s life for long enough. Please consider even a small donation, to help get Dennis back to normal.

We really appreciate any and every donation and any support.

Thank you from the bottom of our hearts,


Traci and Dennis

Single Mom fighting aggressive Thyroid Cancer!,"$700 raised of $16,000 goal","Hi, I'm Daniela. I'm a single mom of 2 kids fighting an aggressive case of thyroid cancer. I live in Puerto Vallarta Mexico, and my doctor says my only fighting chance is to undergo emergency surgery and take expensive prescription medication. If I use government insurance I can't be treated for at least 2 months or more. If I wait that long there is a low probability of survival so I have no choice but to pay for private medical intervention out of my own pocket. I am truly grateful for any help you can give me and my 2 wonderful kids who need their mother.

For a while now, Francis has been battling recurring painful urinary tract infections through bouts of antibiotics, attempts at weight loss, and a very specific (and expensive) prescription diet change. These previous tactics have only been so helpful, and after a couple days full of sonograms, urinalysis, cultures, blood panels, and x-rays, a large bladder stone was located. Tests indicate that the stone cannot be dissolved or treated via medication, and a surgery will be necessary to remove the stone to prevent it from causing even more damage than it already has.

"No gas for Doctors, no supplies to fix the house.","$790 raised of $12,000 goal","Hello, my name is Stephen, For the past 45 years, I have suffered from migraines which have now become chronic intractable migraines and daily pain that would land most in the ER. After my last MRI, my medical team is not ruling out Alzheimer's or dementia and is treating and testing along those lines. For the past 5+ years, due to this, additional comorbidities have developed. I have needed expensive treatments, medications, and equipment to allow me some level of function. In 2017 I was diagnosed with Barrett’s Esophagus with High-Grade dysplasia (esophageal cancer stage 0/1). It took three years of treatment to remission. The cancer was due to daily nausea and vomiting from the migraines, which eroded my esophagus. I have become allergic to anti-nausea medication due to continued use over the years. My BP has become unstable, hitting 200/140 at times, with nearly all prescription medicines doing little to help. Incontinence is a new friend, along with memory loss, severe major depression, and anxiety. To top it off, I had a few strokes over the past year The Drs. found a generalized volume loss, chronic cerebral ischemia, and chronic microvascular ischemic type changes. I am now being treated for that, along with a reduced sensation on my right side. My employer forced me to take medical leave or be fired in late 2019 before the pandemic. I learned fast once it hit that medical care was pretty much out the window, which caused my condition to worsen. I had contingencies; insurance companies don't keep their word during a pandemic, which left me holding the bag three years later and having to collect new medical documentation for disability through the Railroad Retirement Board. I was told that it would take another year to three. With my medical team's assistance and approval, I have found that we have successfully explored treatment and medication options that are now working. These help with the daily pain, nausea, vertigo, blood pressure, depression, and a whole host of other things. My challenge is the costs. With only my wife's Social Security of $1,300 a month, until the Railroad Retirement Board rules on my case, I can't afford to take my medication as prescribed, which is critical, nor can we afford the numerous 200 mile round trips to the doctors. To compound things the house that was left to my wife has turned into a money pit with virtually little to no maintenance done over the course of decades. It needs plumbing, insulation, woodwork, electrical and both the roofs leak. Thanks for any and all thoughts prayers and assistance!!
God bless you! Stephen

Remove Denali's Intestinal Tumor!,"$2,590 raised of $8,000 goal","Hi there! My name is Kirsten and I have had the absolute privilege of being Mandy's friend for over 10 years. From the time I met her, she talked about her childhood dream of having a Husky. A few years later, that dream came true when Denali entered her world!

Here's where you come in! Recently, Denali has been sick. Since March, she has had diarrhea that has gone unimproved unless she is on prednisone. She hasn't been eating well because of this and Mandy has consulted with the vet multiple times regarding nutrition and food recommendations. Despite trying different foods (read: expensive, prescription foods), Denali has lost 10 lbs. Yesterday (July 12, 2023), Denali started to decline pretty quickly, went to Upstate Vet for an emergency visit, and was admitted to internal medicine. During her ultrasound today, a mass in her intestines was found and her intestines were found to be telescoping on themselves. The veterinarian recommended surgery to remove the mass and the telescoped intestines. The surgery is going to be either today or tomorrow, but the cost is great. As it currently stands, the estimate for Denali's overnight stays, diagnostics, and surgery is $6-8,000. I won't know the final cost until the mass is removed, of course, but that is what is currently being communicated to us.

Gizmo Needs RadioIodine Injection!,$660 raised,"Hi, my name is Matthew and I am fundraising for my cat Gizmo, who is 10 years old. About two weeks ago I took Gizmo to the vet for her annual checkup, and was told that he has hyperthryroidism. The vet gave me three options. The first was to change his diet to strictly prescription wet food and nothing else (treats, etc..), but I know how picky Gizmo is, that was not an option. The second option was to put him on medication. The vet said it does help with hyperthyroidism, but that the medication can over time cause things like heart failure, etc... The third option is a radioactive iodine injection, and the only thing the vet said was that it is ""very expensive."" So, I opted for the medication. Sadly, Gizmo is allergic to the medication, as he started developing bald spots behind his ears. Therefore, I did a Google search about the injection, and it says that in over 95 percent of cats, the injection cures the hyperthyroidism. I became upset because my vet made no mention of that, just how expensive it is. So, because he is allergic to the medication, and would not take well to the special diet, the injection is my only option. I have looked around and the least expensive place in my area that I can find is $1,150, of which I have just over half, but no way to secure the other part of the payment. I have asked family and friends, but no one has been able to assist. Gizmo is my baby, I found him eight years ago when I was jogging, he came out from under a car and looked very emaciated and in poor condition. He's been my best buddy now for eight years, and the thought that there is a cure out there and I am currently unable to get for him gives me huge guilt. So, I am asking the GoFundMe community for assistance to help GIzmo get the life lengthening injection and hopefully provide many more years of joy. Thank you so much in advance!

Help Mindie beat the insurance company!!,"$4,605 raised of $5,000 goal","Mindie is having a really difficult time right now..both physically and financially. Her bone marrow is not producing mature red blood cells. Add that to the rheumatoid arthritis, a mass in her one functioning (sort of functioning) kidney, recurring bladder cancer, and other medical problems and you have one very sick woman. She is a trooper; many of may not be aware of how ill she really is. Adding to her stress is the crippling financial cost of her illness. As an example. she has spent 10 hours on the phone this week with her insurance (ha!) company and an organization whose stated purpose is to help uninsured and under insured people with prescription drug costs. Mindie takes 22 prescriptions every day. That works out to 264 prescriptions to pay for every year. Her insurance partially pays for 36 of those prescriptions. She put the 3 most expensive ones through her insurance every month and pays for the rest. The aforementioned organization denied her claim for assistance on an an expensive additional drug prescribed by a specialist because her insurance company said it was a covered drug and she still has refills available to use for the year. Yes, they will cover it but then some other prescription will not be covered. Can't seem to get them to understand. She is so frustrated. I could go on about physician co-pays, blood transfusions and MRIs, etc. but I think it is clear that the medical costs are killing her...literally. Please don' t assume there is some magic program to pay for all this...there isn't. Americans are woefully unaware of the disparity of care in this country. I know she is not your responsibility. I also know she will die before her time from this disease....before me probably. I would just like her to have some peace of mind while she is still alive. I would like her to not wake up every day wondering if their bank account is overdrawn. I would like her to not have to sign a waiver every month stating that she is declining medical care...because she can't afford it. I would like her to have a little fun.

Medical help for Ares,"$1,860 raised of $4,000 goal","I am usually the last person to ask for help because admitting defeat and asking for help is something I’m not good at. 

3 years ago Ares went missing on the 4th of July. He was gone for 19 days and was finally found. Since his disappearance he has had difficulty maintaining his weight. I’ve spent thousands of dollars on testing and the vets cannot find answers. They had me switch his food to an expensive hydrolyzed protein diet which causes him minor allergies but it’s the only diet that has been able to keep weight on him. 

Over the last 1.5 years he’s had recurrent bladder infections. I’ve taken him to the vet multiple times and finally the vet listened to me and did further imaging. He found that Ares bladder is full of stones which was likely caused by his current prescription diet. He recommended I take him to OSU small animal hospital for further testing to make sure he didn’t have bladder cancer. After $1200 the vets at OSU came to the same conclusion as my primary vet. bladder stones with a recommendation to switch Ares to a prescription food that is only made by one company and is among the most expensive prescription foods. 

Ares stones are so significant that he has to have surgery soon so he doesn’t have a blockage. The vet has a starting estimate at $2700 but it’s likely to go higher (because one of the things I saw he forgot was post operative imaging on his estimate and that’s required after this type of surgery). 

I have had an unbelievable increase in emergency expenses in the last 30 days of roughly $10k and quite frankly, my cards are almost maxed. I’m feeling the stress big time and can finally admit that I could use a little help. Surgery is now scheduled for April 6. 

Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

Help Jim Jackson Breath: PAH Medications,"$4,000 raised of $5,000 goal","My husband, Jim, and I have been married 35 years.  We have a combined six children, five grandchildren, and one great granddaughter.  He's always been the strongest man I've known.  He lives life to the fullest.  All that changed March 2012.   He nearly died April 2012 from complication of sepsis which nearly caused multi system organ failure.  He awoke from a coma Easter Sunday, 2012.   Since that time he's fought his way back to remain with me and our family.   He known suffers a host of medical conditions.  Jim was diagnosed in 2016 with portopulmonary hypertension.  The medications that control pressure in his lungs and keep heart from enlarging are extremely expensive yet we've managed to find a way to pay for Opsumit and Sidenafil.  After complications from surgery to repair a broken hip, he requires a third medication, Tyvaso.  Tyvaso is delivered directly to the lungs through and inhalant system, so covered under part B medicare and not through prescription coverage.  The medication is $17,500 per month, so our cost is $3500.  It's been weeks since his doctor has ordered the medication yet without a way to pay for it, I fear his lungs and heart will become more compromised.  Finally recovering from his hip fracture, I want him to be able to exercise.  Swim.  Kayak.  Enjoy the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains.  Due to shortness of breath, most of this is impossible.  He'll eventually require oxygen full time and develop congestive heart failure.  He's my world.  I want him to remain by my side.  Never thought I'd have to ask, to beg for money.  He needs to start treatment as soon as possible.  Thank you for taking the time to read our story.  Please help if you can.  Forward, if you will.

Dom Kinisky (King Dom) Recovery Fund,"$8,415 CAD raised of $10,000 goal","UPDATE:
Since our initial appeal for help, Dom has seen a specialist who delivered some challenging news. The damage to Dom's leg is more severe than initially anticipated, and the recovery process will be much longer and more complex. Instead of a six-week recovery, Dom now faces three surgeries spread over the course of a year, with extended periods of immobility in between each operation. During the first surgery, the doctors repaired two ligaments (MCL and PCL) and addressed bone damage in the knee. Unfortunately, the planned bone graft could not be performed due to the donor bone not meeting the required standards. This graft will now be done during the second surgery, in which the doctors will also break the femur in Dom's left leg, insert a metal rod to straighten it and perform a femoral bone allograft. The third surgery will focus on repairing Dom's ACL.

Medical and Dental Fund,"$2,110 raised of $2,000 goal","As many of you know, I recently (3 weeks ago) spent a week in the hospital fighting for my life.  I was in the ICU for 3 days, on a ventilator, due to a blood clot in my lung. I am now on many expensive prescription drugs, have numerous doctor appointments and am still recovering while trying to get back to work so I can at least pay my mortgage and utilities. I had planned on finding a second job prior to my medial emergency, but right now I am not healthy enough to do that. I may never be again. Only time will tell.

In addition to expenses I have incurred from that, I have also broken a couple of my teeth. I have no means to pay for dental expenses and I must get this addressed. I am asking the gofundme community to help me take care of my health. I do not have insurance. I am one of those people who has fallen through the cracks. I cannot afford Obamacare. Besides, medical insurance doesn't cover dental.

I have three broken teeth, one of which is now broken down to the gums. That particular tooth will have to be surgically removed and given my recent health scare and new medications, will be more complicated than normal. I don't know how much it will cost. I arrived at the number $2000 because it will at least get me in the door somewhere and get the process of repairing my mouth started.

I know people everywhere are struggling but I hope you will consider helping me get this addresses asap. Right now I can't chew on either side of my mouth. I will be forever grateful to all of you. What I lack in money I make up for in kindness and other types of help to others. I promise to pay it forward as best I can with what means I have. Thank you.

Replacement Sunglasses for Isa,$500 raised of $500 goal,"Hi, I’m Isa’s mom and I’m raising money to replace her prescription sunglasses that were washed out to sea last Monday. Isa is very light sensitive and while at the beach she was enjoying the shore with her little cousin and sister. When a wave came and it was clear that it was a strong one, she bent down to keep her little cousin from being pushed down by the wave. That’s when her sunglasses fell off and immediately were swept out. We looked and looked and since they never washed ashore and were swept out, we could not recover them. Being prescription, they were quite expensive and I need help to replace them since I use my insurance for her regular glasses. Any little bit is GREATLY appreciated! Thank you!!","Anaheim, CA"
Pitch in for Pete’s Peter,"$2,230 raised of $4,000 goal","Pete’s human here; recently noticed that Pete was straining to pee almost constantly in strange places with little to no urine coming out. This is abnormal behavior for him (or any cat) and I took him to see the vet. He’s been diagnosed with urethral spasm which puts him at risk for life-threatening obstruction at any time. I have him on three different medications, and have started him on (very expensive) prescription food. 

I’m still paying down the debt incurred from the flood of unexpected and expensive veterinary issues (kittens with Parvo, senior kitty diagnosed with lymphoma and placed on home hospice, toe injury/calcivirus for Pete, tooth extraction for Tex) that all happened within the same month 6 months ago.
This new issue has completely set me back. My pets are family and I’ma responsible pet owner—Pete is insured but so farI’ve spent over $1000 on UNCOVERED expenses and have yet to meet my $500 deductible.

Help Elle Kick Cancer - Treatment Fund,"$4,652 raised of $5,000 goal","Hello friends and anyone kind enough to take the time to read this. Recently my wife Elle Jones was diagnosed with stage 3 triple negative invasive ductal carcinoma which is a very aggressive form of breast cancer. Despite being blessed with health insurance we are quickly finding out the limits to our coverage & how unexpected expenses and uncovered prescriptions costs can easily spiral out of control. Recently I was lucky that because even though we had to go into our rent for the next month, my wife didn’t have to leave the doctor’s office without an expensive prescription that was needed to save her life but somehow the costs was not mentioned until that moment. Unfortunately the prescription will need to be refilled at the end of every chemo visit at that same cost.

Since my wife is currently unable to work (something that she has pride fully done all of her adult life) we are beginning to feel how an unexpected illness can take even a gainfully employed family to the edge of bankruptcy. We are a proud family who raised 4 boys without assistance & we were just beginning to experience the joys of being grandparents. We don't give in easily to the idea of seeking financial help from an outside source. Even the amount we are asking is modest in light of what we are facing but I still hope to cover most of what we need myself.

But when it comes to the life & well-being of your family you find that the list of what you normally wouldn’t do get smaller every day. And open your eyes to the truth of how far you will go to make sure that 25 years turns into 50 more. So in truth I am not asking for financial assistance. I am asking for people who can relate to our situation, for help in preserving a life. A life of much value to those she has touched & for a chance to touch many more. If you find it in your heart to bless our family a donation in any amount will be appreciated and may be the amount that makes the difference. Thank you for your support in advance!

Sincerely,

Help for senior dog Daisey,"$16,525 CAD raised of $10,000 goal","❤ Please help support this Go Fund Me campaign to help provide palliative care for my friend's sweet, loving, senior rescue dog: Daisey. Their mom Juli has been a long-term volunteer in pet loss support and is a long-standing animal rescuer and advocate for many animal organizations, and she knows all too well the heartbreak that comes with dealing with senior animals! Daisey is her fur-child and she means the world to her.  Update: Juli's other dog Sadie became very unwell and very sadly, Juli had to let her go, on Tuesday, May 28th.  :(  
Daisey is continuing to respond well to treatment but needs ongoing medical care.

Daisey's medical issues took a bit of a 'back seat' to Sadie's needs when Sadie was very ill. Sadly Sadie is gone, however Daisey still needs help, especially now. Daisey was diagnosed with a serious gastrointestinal condition called Protein Losing Enteropathy, which causes weight loss and muscle wastage. Over the previous 8 months Daisey lost more than 6 pounds, which is an incredible amount for a small dog. This happened despite her having a very good appetite and eating substantial quantities of food but her body was not absorbing the nutrients and protein from the food.   This condition (PLE) is similar to Irritable Bowel Syndrome in some ways but it is more serious. It is treated by feeding a very strict diet and steroids to help reduce inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract.  Daisey is on a very special prescription dog food diet, and also gets cooked boneless chicken breast along, with daily medications. 

Thanks to a wonderful internal medicine specialist veterinarian, Daisey is finally on the right food and seems to be responding well to the treatment. She has gained a pound so far, (which is like an average human gaining about 20 pounds) so that is very promising! Hopefully she continues to gain more weight and can get closer to her more normal weight over the coming months. Ideally Daisey needs to continue to be monitored and to receive specialty veterinary care but each visit is quite expensive (about $300 including blood tests). The main concern is that her protein levels are normal and that she doesn't become anaemic.

PRK (Lasik) corrective surgery cost - Las Vegas,"$485 raised of $5,000 goal","Hi, my name is Josh. I am 33 this year and I've had advanced astigmatism in both eyes with severe nearsightedness since before I started school. My prescription makes my glasses or contacts very expensive. I've felt extremely limited in my activity and experiences due to my vision. I've gone through eye injuries from contact use and been unable to replace glasses when needed due to prescription costs. I want to know what it's like to not rely on corrective crutches that restrict my experiences. My cornea has always been too thin to consider LASIK, but I recently found a surgical alternative for people in my situation called PRK. I am just barely a candidate with my cornea and level of correction needed, but they are confident in doing the procedure. The recovery time is much longer than LASIK and many more symptoms to overcome. There is slightly more risk than LASIK, but I'm determined to take the chance to see the world naturally for the first time. Due to the level of correction needed I was quoted at roughly 2500 dollars per eye. Insurance does not cover the procedure because it is considered elective and cosmetic despite my prescription.   I figured I would ask the ether for some help. I appreciate anyone's consideration or contribution. This is life-changing for me.

Save panzers life surgery,"$1,460 raised of $2,500 goal","This is panzer he is just over 1 and had developed a blockage. We did one vet who tried a catheter to clear but couldn't get in and I think damaged him as he swelled up bad. Then he spent 48 hours on a catheter clearing him. Did great. But less than 12 hours off was in terrible pain and not peeing. He was so swollen and damage that taking him back to the er for another catheter just was impossible. He is currently there waiting for clinics and surgeons to open to find out cost for either a pu ( which may not be able to fix the leak that a contrast showed now) or a surgeon to do uretha repair. They are draining his bladder for now with a needle til then.
I can not get approved any credits. I've tanked my score trying to get loans. And my brother is about tapped out on what he can help with. Of We can just do pu it would be 1600 to 2000. We have no idea on surgeon cost yet but will be over 2000.

He is just a baby and is the sweetest thing. He runs to anyone and cuddles and doesn't deserve this.","Oak Hill, VA"

"Surgery for my cat, Bean",$600 raised,"My cat bean has been struggling with FLUTD, he is only a year and a half old and has been in and out of the vet for the passed 6 months or so. I spend quite a bit of money on him monthly to try and help him get back on track. Hes currently on purina urinary tract prescribed food that cost about 70$ a month, this will now be switched to another prescription food that's a little more expensive at 80$ a month. I also pay for his fluoxetine prescription (40$) to try and help him. His symptoms include yowling in pain, continuously licking his genitals, inability to urinate and basically your general uti symptoms. In the future this could eventually cause his kidney health to decline or he could be unable to urinate and die within days. Starting yesterday(April 18th) the situation has worsened, he is now in an emergency vet hospital and will be there for 3-5 days with a catheter in because his bladder was swollen and he was unable to produce any urine. As of right now the last I was told is they will finally be removing his catheter tonight (April 19th) and seeing how he does without it. This whole stay and procedure has already taken 880$ and will end up costing between 1400-1700$. I will post the receipts for everything I've done for him to this point in the evening tomorrow(April 20) and if I get to pick him up tomorrow I will also post that receipt. So to wrap this up, I was told at this vet visit that there was an option for surgery to help him urinate by making his urethra bigger, its referred to as a PU or perineal urethostomy. This surgery will cost me 3500$ and is the only thing I really need help covering and the only thing that can let him live a normal healthy long rest of his life. They also gave me the option of euthanizing my sweet boy but that's just not an option in my book. Hes only 1 year and a half old and the sweetest boy who doesnt deserve any of this. All help will be appreciated including just sharing his story to get him the help he deserves. Thank you to anyone who can help! I will continue to give updates!

Medical and Financial Help from Car Accident.,"$395 raised of $3,000 goal","Hello, my name is Lizbeth D. and I am attempting to raise funds for my mother, Carmen D. On June 12, 2023, my mom and her friend were in a car accident on S. Wayside Dr and Sylvan Rd in HTX @ 10pm. My mom’s friend luckily is fine as her airbag went off and she sustained little to no injury at all. However, that was not the case for my mother. My mom’s airbag did not go off at all and sustained much more injury. She sustained 2 fractured ribs, a swollen foot (torn ligament), and possible lung issue that was not fully discussed the night of the accident. A few weeks ago, we also found out my mother has sustained some injury in her back as well and will be needing medication for that. And today, (8/15), we found out she has lung issues and will be needing more medication for that too. And due to so much injury, my mom has been unable to work for the past 2 months. So, It is becoming overwhelmingly difficult to maintain costs when only one person is able to work for a family of 4 (excluding 2 dogs, a cat, and a turtle.) I did not want to air out my personal business but we need help. My mom is in excruciating pain and I want to help her as best as I can.

Emily Songer & Family Medical Funding,"$3,910 raised of $10,000 goal","We are Matthew and Tiffany Lake and we are fundraising for Keshia Songer, a dear friend and employee who's 23 year old daughter, Emily Songer, was involved in a bad car accident while traveling to a concert in Las Vegas. Although riding in the backseat and wearing a seat belt, with only modest external trauma, it quickly became apparent that there were internal injuries and emergency surgery was required. Unfortunately, Emily’s body has not responded well to the trauma and subsequent surgery. The damage to her digestive system was severe and she is facing the possibility of being permanently on TPN (Total Parenteral Nutrition) with an expected lifespan of just a few years, an unacceptable outcome. As you might imagine, her family is exploring additional testing and treatment alternatives that could produce a better outcome for a previously healthy and vibrant 23 year old. But they are hampered with the challenges of maintaining a steady presence and being a local advocate at an out of town hospital. Emily is currently several hundred miles from either parent, isn’t strong enough to travel and requires a very expensive nutritional prescription that requires skilled administration. Unfortunately her insurance won’t pay for the special transport and technical support during transport that she needs even though being closer to family to explore, schedule and enable treatment will be crucial. Although the uncertainty of Emily’s future is the biggest issue and the highest priority for everyone involved, the insurance challenges and medical bills are also adding to the stress. Please help us in providing this sweet family with additional funding for housing, food, and care in their extreme time of need.

Please help with Hank's medical bills!,"$3,282 raised of $3,000 goal","Hi, I'm Laura. My husband Randy and I are asking for help to cover our cat's current and upcoming medical bills. We are hoping that your kindness will help us not only with the $2500 that we've already spent, but also a little extra to cover his necessary medical and home care in the next few weeks.
Hank was an outdoor cat right up until September 23, when he got all of his rotting teeth removed due to stomatitis. Without one of his major defense mechanisms, Hank would be open to injury from other cats and wildlife outside. So we brought him indoors, and he's done surprisingly well in our downstairs level. My ""Good Little Man"" keeps me company when I work, and enjoys the view through the sliding glass doors. We were in the slow process of integrating Hank into the rest of the household with our other three cats.

Help Reishi the Kitten Receive Life-Saving Surgery,"$272 raised of $2,100 goal","Dear friends, family, and fellow animal lovers, I'm reaching out for your help to save our precious 5-month-old kitten, Reishi. Recently, Reishi suffered from a urinary tract blockage that required emergency surgery. The total cost of the surgery came to $2000, which has put a significant strain on my finances.

Prescription Sunglasses for Chronic Photophobia,$320 raised of $320 goal,"Vision is important for any sighted person, and is an immense hurdle I've been attempting to overcome.
For over 8 years now, I've suffered from chronic pain in the form of chronic daily intractable headaches along with severe light sensitivity, which has severely impacted my ability to do much of anything in the form of work, even causing me to leave highschool at 15 years old. I am now almost 24.
What this means is that my headaches, although likely hereditary in origin, are medication resistant and thus, I have found no relief or treatment that alleviates my migraines in the last 8 years.
The only alleviating factors thus far have been a dark room, and prescription sunglasses have been a game changer for allowing me to actually leave my room after spending two years bedridden and locked in there.

Wednesday night (2/21) we got home from work and found Hank breathing erratically, not moving, and refusing food. After taking him to the emergency vet, we found out that his bladder is completely blocked, causing him extreme pain, making him unable to urinate, and potentially damaging his kidneys.

Unfortunately, the only treatment for him was a costly multi-day stay at the vet, where he was sedated, had a catheter inserted, and pumped with fluids to flush out his bladder and clear the blockage. He was then sent home on lots of medication with the possibility of him getting blocked again, having to repeat this entire treatment, and possibly even surgery. In addition to all that, he’ll have to be on expensive prescription food for the rest of his life.

Hello,
My name is Tashira McCoy and my mother Tracy Johnson passed away in the early morning hours of Thursday, June 29th, 2023. My mother has had a pretty extreme track record when it comes to illnesses. In 2008 she suffered from the complications of a subarachnoid brain hemorrhage, which had her in a coma for a couple of weeks. The most peculiar thing about it though, was that her eyes would be closed shut and the doctor would come in and call her name and would not get a response, then my aunt would do the same still no response. However when I said ""Mommy"" her eyes would open up real wide and then close back. We did this a couple of times just to make sure it was not a fluke. My mother always fought to come back to me, her love for me put doctors' medical hypotheses to shame. She recovered from that and we went on with our lives. Then in August of 2015, due to a pulmonary embolism caused by her sickle cell disease, she suffered over 30 mini-strokes that left her in a coma and on a ventilator for 3 months. All of her doctors were telling me that she would not make it through and if she did she would not be who she used to be and that she would never be able to live on her own again or take care of herself. On the day that I was going to allow them to take her off of the ventilator, the neurologist on her case came into the room and said that he wanted to try putting a trach in her neck, to see if that would help because it would allow more oxygen to go to her brain. He also said he did not know if it would work or not, but he wanted to try and at that point, I did not have anything to lose so I allowed it. Two days after the trach was put in, my mother began to become more alert, trying to speak, recognizing myself and other family members, blowing kisses at me and mouthing Muah! This is something that she had done with me since I was a baby and it was such a joy and a blessing to have her do that again because I went without it for months. We went through occupational, physical and cognitive therapy. I resigned from my job to assist her because she needed full-time around-clock care. I assisted her in learning how to walk again, talk again, and use the restroom on her own, she had to relearn all the everyday things that healthy people take for granted daily. Between 2015 and 2017, while going through the rehabilitation we went through being evicted and had to stay at an extended stay for a couple of weeks It took some time and we both had many stressful moments but at the end of her rehabilitation, she made a full recovery. She was my walking miracle. There were lots of long and sleepless nights from falls or incontinence incidents in the middle of the night, and a lot of tears but we made it through. She was able to go back to work, as was I and we returned to our lives. By 2018, we were back to dominating the world as we liked to say. However, towards the end of 2020, she began to have Sickle Crises more frequently, and they were so bad that she was always admitted to the hospital and each crisis was a 4-day minimum hospital stay. She began to have really bad pain in her right knee and hip even when her body was not in crisis, and that's when we found out that she developed Avascular Neurosis which exasperated her sickle cell and rheumatoid arthritis, which made her physically unable to work. We finally find out that the crisis was becoming so frequent and painful because of Avascular Neurosis, which is when the cells begin to eat away at the bone from the inside. So combined with the sickle cell, the sickled cells would clump together to further assist with attacking the same areas as the avascular Neurosis, causing further degeneration of bone. She also began to have blood clots. There was one in her lung one hospital visit, one in her leg on another and one in her arm on a different visit. Subsequently, she had to be put on blood thinners, and each prescription cost $510. In the beginning, she was able to receive them because she was working at Amazon and had health insurance through them, but due to the repeated hospital visits she had to go out on disability and once her short-term disability ended, all of her health care benefits ended as well, as any life insurance she had set aside for me to take care of her final arrangements and to at least leave me something behind. Amazon cuts off benefits after short-term disability and does not offer it for long-term disability and denied her claim for it. Before all of this happened she was working at Amazon and as soon as her short-term disability was over they took away all of her benefits and denied her long-term disability saying that the Avascular Necrosis was a pre-existing condition which it was not. My mother went two years without an income and was not able to pay the premiums, there is no life insurance to help with her final burial arrangements or anything for me to handle her final wishes and business. Before she passed she was in the middle of repealing it even in the middle of the sickle cell crisis, the blood clots, and her steady health decline. For two and a half years my mother dealt with frequent sickle cell crises, blood clots, and the degeneration of the bones in her body,all the while appealing her long-term disability while dealing with multiple hospital stays and constant pain. However, she kept fighting until she couldn't anymore. On the morning of Saturday, June 24th, I woke up to my mother in a very confused state of mind, it took several minutes for her to tell me the correct date and day of the week. I told her we should go to the hospital, but she begged and pleaded with me saying she did not want to be in the hospital again and that she was just tired and needed some rest. The next day I woke up and she was more confused. I attempted to take her to the hospital myself but she was unable to sit or stand, she could not even hold on to her walker, so I called the paramedics. I met them at the hospital and they told me that it looks like she has sepsis which is a blood infection, and confusion is one of the symptoms she was having, test came back negative for any bacteria in her blood or urine. They also took a CAT scan of her brain and an EEG and both did not show anything peculiar. They did not perform an MRI when she first arrived because they are expensive and my mother only had Medicaid insurance and the MRI team is only at the hospital (Presbyterian Novant) during the week, but her cognitive state continued to decline. By that Monday she no longer recognized me and was mistaking me for my grandmother, there was nothing that I could do.Tuesday night they had to put her in restraints and have a sitter with her for 24 hours a day because she kept trying to get out of the bed and pull out her catheter and IV even though she could not walk, but she did not understand that. She did not know where she was or who even I was. On Tuesday I finally spoke to the neurologist who after caring for her since Sunday decided that they would have to sedate her in order to get an MRI because it was obvious at that point that something was extremely wrong. Even though I was telling both nurses and doctors about her health history they kept telling me it was a blood infection, until they realized the mental decline was real and ongoing. The neurologist scheduled the MRI and Lumbar Pncture for 2 pm Wednesday. On Wednesday at about noon, I received a call from an ICU nurse that my mother's heart had stopped and that they were doing chest compressions and that I should get to the hospital as soon as possible. As I was arriving I heard on the intercom that there was a code blue on the third floor which was the floor they were leading me to. I asked the nurse to check and the code blue was my mother. In between her heart-stopping those two times, her brain went without oxygen for over 12 minutes. She was on life support and medications were the only thing that were keeping her heart beating. They performed another EEG and the results were that there was no brain activity. The doctor on duty told me that at this point we will just have to see and wait. By 8:00 pm that evening I get a call from the night shift doctor telling me that they are not able to keep her blood pressure above 60 and that there is a very high likely hood that she would not make it through the night. I went up to the hospital to say the last goodbyes to my mother who was my best friend, my heart and my righthand. Even though everything was showing that there was no brain activity I still felt as though she could hear me. I sat down next her, held her hand and I told her I loved her more than life itself and that I knew that she was tired, that she had been fighting for so long and that she did what she needed to do to raise me and that I would be ok, and that it was ok for her to go home and get some rest and peace. Now it could have just been in my mind but I promise her face relaxed a little. I believe she was waiting on me to give her permission to go home and I obliged. I had to put in a DNR order in case her heart stopped again because I knew that she would not want to live the rest of her life in that state. My mother was always laughing and talking, she was so fun-loving and loved to laugh and make jokes. She had a fighting spirit that I have never seen and I do not think that I will ever see it again. Even with all the hospital visits back and forth over the last few years she never gave up and she never stopped fighting. Unfortunately this time her body was tired and she just could not pull through this one. God called her home so that she could be at peace and not have to fight anymore. She even got the chance to see that I would be able to take care of myself, with all of the things that she instilled in me and I think that is why she was able to let go. My mother Tracy Johnson, had the greatest laugh in the world, even if you did not know what she was laughing about just hearing it made you laugh. She had a heart made of gold and loved everyone just because they were human. I blame Amazon for not looking into her medical history further, and recognizing that she was the perfect candidate for Long-Term Disability.

Calcifer Expensive Testing! Plz Help $$,"$1,090 raised","Dearest friends, family, and Calcifer fans,

My son has been chewing off his fur for about a full year now - and he's starting to chew off his skin!!! :((

And after many rounds of different treatments (meds, pills, prescription food, different doctors, etc.) the next step is an overall allergy test since nothing has changed, and symptoms are getting worse. As most of you know, I've recently left my job, and have been putting off this test for a while now it is so expensive, but both Calcifer and I are very upset at the condition of his current problem - and we have yet to find out what exactly the problem is.

Windy's Amputation & Midnight-Geraldo Hospice Care,$215 raised,"Saving Kittens Sanctuary saved these two cats from a life of debilitating pain and suffering. Windy had a leg fracture in 3 places with a dislocated elbow, and Midnight is a hospice case of an elderly kitty who was left outside this winter when his owner moved, and he subsequently developed severe hypothermia which caused irreparable kidney damage. Instead of euthanizing, Saving Kittens Sanctuary pulled these two into the rescue. Windy will live the rest of her life pain free and happy, and Midnight is currently on hospice care for his last weeks/months of life as he is in end stage renal failure. He is currently on very expensive prescription food and kidney flushes, and the costs for bloodwork, antibiotics, and other comfort care are mounting. We feel Midnight deserves to live his last days as comfortably as possible since he has fought so, so hard to survive. Using rescue resources on high-cost cases does reduce the ability for the rescue to intake new cases. Please donate/help if you can.

Help Rosemary make it through a tough time,"$7,402 raised of $8,000 goal","Hello, friends,

I've had cancer twice in the past few years, and it took a big toll on me financially, as I was unable to work much of the time. I've been living on the edge for a while, but now I need help. I'm raising funds to pay three mortgage payments (two are overdue), plus an expensive prescription I need for asthma.  

It will mean so much to me to be able to cover these expenses. I have been so stressed out by being behind in my mortgage payments, and I also really need the asthma medication, which is something I normally use twice a day every day. 

I believe (and hope) that with your help to take care of these expenses, I will once again be able to make it on my own. I'm currently designated cancer-free.

Some of you have already helped me in the past, and for that I am so grateful. I will also be very grateful for every contribution, no matter how small, to help me now. Thank you all so very much!!! 

p.s.
I have some hair now:

Arklow the Irish Wolfhound Chaos Agent,"$2,092 raised of $7,500 goal","As many of you know, I do my best to run Rockit Ranch Rescue and Sanctuary with a whole lot of help from folks like you: our irreplaceable friends and donors. At Rockit Ranch, I care for 6 dogs, a varying number of cats, 3 horses, and Gringo aka Bedonkadonk, one very stubborn donkey, which are all I can handle in my current physical condition. I recently took in a young Irish Wolfhound under some concerning circumstances, and the things I was told about him have proved to be untrue. To summarize, Arklow needs a number of medical treatments and tests, which I will describe below, but initially, for my safety and the safety of the smaller dogs, he needs immediate training before he inadvertently injures me.

Arklow is a handful - a rambunctious over 100-pound puppy. He just wants to play, but he’s started roughhousing me when I take the other dogs out in the morning and at other times and recently knocked me down in the process of mauling me for fun - my greatest fear is falling because I can’t get up due to severe scoliosis - and it was terrifying even though he was not menacing in that sense of the word. I fell on my already bad knee and already broken shoulder and the impact gave me a vision migraine. My neighbor tried to help me get up, but it was really hard, and I am still in a lot of pain from the incident. There is more to say about his behavior but, to summarize, he must be sent out to be trained before he hurts one of us, and that is a costly undertaking. Despite this incident, he is sweet-natured and deserves to become a loving and trustworthy member of our family.

Emergency Bladder Stone Surgery for our cat Kiki,"$205 raised of $5,000 goal","Hello, My name is Eugene. My family and I are trying to raise funds so we can get an important surgery for our cat Kiki. She has developed bladder stones which left untreated can be life threatening. We brought her to an emergency animal hospital and some $600 dollars later were advised she needs an operation upwards of $4000.00, to remove the stones or she could have many complications up to and including death if the stones move and block her urethra. She is a wonderful, docile and loving family pet that our family is very concerned about. We are currently feeding her a special prescription diet (very expensive). We are reaching out asking friends, family or animal lovers for any help financially to help us save our poor little one. I am retired and basically on a fixed income having difficulties making ends meet and this obviously is making it even more difficult. All funds will be used toward Kiki's surgery, follow up and aftercare. Thank you so much for any help you can find it in your heart give.","Fall River, MA"
Ronda’s Medical Expenses - Fighting Brain Cancer,"$13,711 raised","In early August 2022, my mom was laid off from her job. In the following months, she attempted to get Medicare and unemployment benefits while continuing to apply for new employment, but she was unable to get anything finalized.By the time Thanksgiving came, she had become a shell of herself. We (my family and I) thought she was going through a depression spell due to being laid off so close to retirement, but then she started to show worsening symptoms. She rapidly lost weight, trembled so bad she couldn’t type, had major memory issues, and had begun falling frequently. After a particularly scary fall, I decided to take her to the emergency room. She couldn’t wait for her insurance to get sorted - she needed care.After some imaging and testing, the emergency department discovered a baseball-sized mass in her brain and blood clots in her lungs. The pressure from the mass was causing most of her motor and memory issues, which explained her inability to complete tasks in the months leading up to that day. She was immediately admitted and would go one to spend 28 days in the hospital. She underwent two major surgeries - one craniotomy to remove the tumor and a second to remedy some complications from the first operation. As you can imagine, spending 28 days in the hospital including two major operations and two stints in the ICU can rack up quite a bill.After she was admitted, I went to her house to gather her mail and paper and began to try to fix her financial situation. I was able to secure her Medicare Part A quickly but I am still waiting for her Part B to be added. We had to complete a special enrollment application and the process has been murky and frustrating. Unfortunately, without Part B coverage, all of her specialist visits (radiation, oncology, neurosurgery, vascular surgery, etc.) remain uncovered and will be billed as “self pay.” I was able to get Part D prescription coverage as well, but her medications are still very expensive as there are not generic forms available due to their specialized nature. One of her prescriptions is $500 for a two month supply and we still don’t have an approximate cost for her chemo pills.In addition to working on her insurance, I also helped her apply for retirement and disability benefits. I am also working with an attorney to get her unemployment back pay. Unfortunately, none of these will be immediate fixes. Social Security’s own application tracker states the average turnaround for benefit review is 272 days. I am currently managing her household expenses with her savings. With a daunting diagnosis and no income, you can imagine the amount of stress my mom is feeling knowing what expenses have already accrued and what lies ahead. Her official diagnosis is glioblastoma multiforme, which is an aggressive and sneaky brain cancer. It requires a gauntlet of treatment due to its complexity and likelihood to recur. She has agreed to let me open a fundraiser on her behalf to help us with her initial medical expenses while we work to get her insurance and benefits sorted. All of our friends and loved ones have been so generous already. Your words of love and encouragement inspire her to fight each day. Anything you are able to donate is much appreciated.

Help us overcome infertility & grow our Family!,"$1,500 raised of $18,000 goal","Hi, our names are Matthew & Andrea Pate. We have been together for 5 amazing years and are working on our third year of marriage. Right now our little family consists of Nyles, our 13 year old son, Mayia, our scruffy little dog and Penelope our loving cat. Unfortunately,  after years of trying we have been unable to grow our family by having any children together.

Our journey started shortly after our wedding and after the first year we realized we needed help and began seeing fertility specialists. The last two years have had many ups and downs, from multiple doctors in and out of town to countless hours and hundreds of miles driven to see specialists. A barrage of tests, specialized fertility vitamins, expensive prescription medications, bi-weekly intramuscular injections, blood, sweat, and lots of tears.

Everyday we work to push the odds in trying to conceive a miracle. Daily hormone and ovulation tests have become the norm, filling calendars with data and tracking peak levels down to the hour. Planning, trying, hoping.

In 2020 we began seeing a fertility specialist in Las Vegas, Nevada which allowed us to be close to family, helping reduce the strain of travel and heavy emotions. After multiple visits, more tests and months of following new recommendations, we received our latest results on January 21, 2021. Analysis showed an increase in count but an overall decrease in everything else.


Heart shattering.


Our next step and only option left is (IVF). This means many more doctor appointments, blood work, expensive medications, hysteroscopy preparatory surgery, egg collection, sperm collection, freezing, fertilization and re-insertion of the embryo not to mention all the little things in between. 

None of the procedures and medication are covered by insurance even on the highest level plans. Adding in travel expenses and prescription medication we estimate the total cost of around $20,000 - $25,000.

Every day that goes buy decreases our likelihood to conceive. Right now we are working on saving everything we can to make this dream become a reality. Our goal is to be ready to try by August 2021.

If you or someone you know would like to donate in support of our families Journey, we would be eternally grateful!




With love and hope,
Matt & Andrea Pate

My Cat Has Urinary Track Crystals and Needs Care,"$657 CAD raised of $2,400 goal","Hi, I'm Shawn and I am trying to care for My young sick cat.

Diagnosed with urinary crystals and infection at just over a year and a half. In 5 weeks we have been to two vets. Tried antibiotics and relaxants, and expensive prescription food. It seems to be reoccurring consistently towards the end of each treatment.

UPDATES: August 24th: Wag has taken his last antibiotic last night. He has been doing well and I am hoping that we are going to be okay. I am still struggling with the costs of food and recent care. I would like to have a minimum of a follow-up saved, but ideally enough to cover the worst-case scenario (surgery) should the need arise.

Need help with vet health costs for senior cat,$259 raised of $600 goal,"I'm quite embarrassed to have reached this point, but I have no other choice. My name is Amina, and I've grown up with my cat Shiba since I was a little girl. We've been through everything together, and the mere thought of losing her breaks my heart. As I was a minor, I was never able to take her to the vet. My caregivers refused too.

Right now, I am 20, a student, and hold a part-time job. Since getting my job, I was finally able to take the now 16 yearold Shiba to an overdue vet visit. She has many issues - obesity, stage 2 kidney disease, diabetes, and teeth issues. I know its not my fault - but I'll always blame myself for being in a position where there was nothing I could do in prior years.

Truett and Debbie's medical bills,"$3,322 raised of $7,259 goal","Hi, my name is Wayne and I am raising money for my parents, Truett and Debbie Pool. In the last year both have been hospitalized. Mom spent approximately one week in a rehabilitation facility and has numerous doctor, rehab and other medical bills. Dad spent a few days in the hospital and had subsequent surgery. He is also scheduled for more surgery soon. Prescription medication is also becoming more expensive. We are also lookingto make changes to their home to make normal living easier for them. While their insurance does pay some of the bills, it does not take care of everything. They are unable to keep up with the medical bills and other expenses. While I help as much as I can, I can not keep up either because I have my own expenses. They are both looking for jobs but their health situations severely limit what they can do. They do not like the idea of asking for money but when roles are reversed they are always the first to give. As many of you know, both Truett and Debbie provide help and assistance to many in their church and others who might need it. This time they need the help with medical and other living expenses. I'm hoping all the people they have helped, and all those that love them, will give generously to help them during this time.","San Antonio, TX"
Cash’s Neuro Surgery Fundraiser,"$2,335 raised of $8,000 goal","Meet Cash. He is a 5 year old Golden Retriever and I’ve had him since he was 7 weeks old. At the beginning of the month, I noticed him acting oddly lethargic and took him into his primary veterinarian for an exam. Over the last 2 weeks, that escalated into 4 additional vet visits, numerous tests, x-rays, a variety of expensive prescription drugs and was referred to a specialist. On December 19th, he was seen by a neurologist that looked over his medical file and recent x-rays of his cervical discs (C2/C3) and determined he needs an immediate MRI and spinal surgery. Which of course,  this type of medical procedures are not covered under his current pet insurance plan. 
As some of you may already know, Pet Hospital’s require full payment upfront before these kind of procedures can take place. Being a young working professional making an average income in the Portland area, I don’t have the funds to cover the rest of his medical expenses and I’ve already liquidated my personal savings.

We are setting up this gofundme for Amy during this time to help her with her medical expenses.  Amy has been battling Pheochromocytoma which has metastasized into Paraganglima.   She has several tumors all over her body, including her sacum, liver, kidney, lungs and superior vena cava.  Amy is on disability and has medicare which doesn’t come with prescription coverage. Last year she only took two medications, this year, she is now on 23 oral and 3 internal medications. Some of them have no generics and cost thousands of dollars each month. Medicare only covers 80% of medical procedures and hospital stays and she is responsible for the other 20%. One scan can cost 90,000.   Between October of last year and now she has spent about 3 months in the hospital for various stays. 

Her family has been helping out A LOT, but being sick is very expensive and we felt it was time to ramp up the help and allow others who want to help Amy, to contribute too.

The money raised will go towards Amy's medical expenses and medications.  We acknowledge now is a difficult time for many and we are gracious for any donation you can offer.

Help Sen Thach Pay his Medical Bills!,"$3,599 raised of $3,500 goal","Hi, my name is Rohan Singh. I am currently a junior attending Bowling Green High School. I recently met Sen Tach, a 59-year-old patient of my mother, and learned about Mr. Tach's disheartening life predicament.
Mr.Tach moved to the United States in 1993 from his native country of Vietnam. Over the course of the next two decades, he and his wife worked hard to raise a family of five, and they worked unbearably long hours at a factory and doing odd jobs to make ends meet.
At the age of 50, Mr. Tach started developing serious health problems that eventually led to end-stage kidney disease (kidney failure), heart disease, Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome among other problems. Over the past year, he has been hospitalized several times for complications related to these problems. He was started on dialysis for his failed kidneys. As a result, he is no longer able to continue working and the family is now solely dependent on his wife who earns $13.00 an hour working at a factory.
As mentioned previously, Sen requires daily peritoneal dialysis and expensive medications. During a recent follow-up appointment, Sen admitted that he had stopped taking several prescription medications due to excessive financial constraints. 
Not to mention, Sen’s wife, Nu Pham, also has several health issues of her own and requires a dozen prescription medications as well. 
Besides the medical expenses, they live in a rented apartment for which they have to pay $1,000 per month.
They have both accumulated medical bills amounting to $2,957 that they owe out of pocket. By raising $3,500, I am not only hoping to pay off their medical debts, but also provide enough money to help sustain the cost of his medications until he is eligible for disability coverage.
All I ask is that you help me in my pursuit of raising money for this man and his family, a family that doesn't deserve to be in the unfortunate situation that they are in. Every donation is appreciated. 

Thank you! -Rohan Singh

Let's Help Katie!,"$1,878 raised of $5,000 goal","As most of you know, Katie had a brain aneurysm in June 2014. Since this time, she has been having seizures.  In December 2018, she had a string of seizures, making it impossible for her to work. She was laid off by her employer and has been collecting unemployment because she cannot work until the seizures are under control.  Her dilemma is that when she lost her job, she lost her insurance. She has applied for Badger Care, but was denied because she is over the income limit by $144/month. We are in the process of applying for other programs, but in the meantime she still needs her medication!  It is very expensive and with no insurance she cannot afford to buy it with what she makes on unemployment. She only has a couple days left of one prescription and is not able to fill the other two at this time due to her financial situation. Please help in any way you can.  We want to try to raise enough money for her to get at least 6 months worth of medication, and hopefully by then one of the state programs that she is applying for will come through for her.  This kid needs a break! No 22 year old should have to handle this much stress.  Thanks in advance!","Appleton, WI"

Harper Avery GoFundMe,"$2,805 raised of $1,000 goal","Hi, my name is Harper Avery. I have been in the emergency hospital for a couple days fighting a multiple bacterial infection that almost took my life. The vet said I have something called gastroenteritis. I do have some other underlining health conditions, which makes it a bit difficult for my doctors to treat me. The medications that are typically used for this type of infection are not really safe for me to be on due to my liver issues. I am now being treated from home, and doing my best to fight off this infection with O2 (as needed), probiotics, fluids, anti-nausea medications and daily supplements. I will need follow up care with the specialist who diagnosed me with an abnormally small sized liver and micro liver shunts. I will need frequent lab work done and an endoscopy to rule out other things. We hope that this is just an isolated incident but want to be sure that there are no other underlying health conditions that we may not be aware of. The cost of my prescription food and daily medications are expensive and although my mommy and daddy hate asking for help, because of their love for me they are asking for assistance from those that are able to financially assist us in getting me better. If you are able to help, it would be much appreciated. If you would like proof of bills, no offense will be taken, just PM my mommy and she will send you pictures of them.

Team Price’s Boss Fight Against Cancer,"$53,984 raised of $100,000 goal","Team Price Boss Fight Against Cancer is a crowdfunding campaign for Vincent Price and his family to help them during Vincent’s treatment for cancer. We are hoping this is a chance, if you can, to be a light in the objectively awful year for a wonderful family going through a lot. 
There have been and will continue to be, large expenses that the family cannot absorb. We love them and they WON’T struggle alone. Donated funds will help the family manage these difficult times by leaning on their community. It is time for us to help them win this boss fight!

The whole boss fight over the course of 2020 & 2021 is huge, $170,000 due to a combination of things like the ""fun"" that is the American health care system, household expenses while Vince can't work, and accessibility improvements to the home so he can move around during treatment.  As most of us are familiar with gaming the boss keeps getting bigger and stronger as we level up. The same can be said for this fundraiser. We are leveling this effort into smaller chunks, starting with the most urgent needs first. We want to support them as much as we can but we don't want this fight to be daunting.

We hope to fund the first level as soon as possible so the Prices can get their finances in a better place. Once we are close to funding the first tier goal we will extend the campaign goal to include the second tier and so on. Thank you so much for contributing to and helping to spread this campaign. The support and encouragement you bring to Team Price are invaluable!

Improve ketamine treatment for medicaid patients,$320 raised,"A new community mental health clinic designed to take care of severely depressed and suicidal patients using ketamine (and eventually other FDA-approved psychedelics) will be opening in Maine. This will be the first such clinic to make this physician and nurse-supervised treatment available and affordable for Medicaid patients. While the treatment space is large enough to treat six patients at a time, it is cold and spartan. We know from a few studies that aesthetic scenes--particularly with a high fractal content, like nature scenes--can improve mental health outcomes. Our goal is to beautify the clinic with paintings by local artists. We plan to have artists do this voluntarily, but we will require material supplies (hospital-safe paint, brushes, drop cloths, food to feed the volunteers, etc.). Please help us reach our goal and provide access to these important treatments in a warm, welcoming (and not austere) setting.

Thank you,

Cancer Treatment Costs,"$99,295 raised of $150,000 goal","My name is Katie Norton and I created this page to help raise money for my little brother, Sam who is battling cancer. Sam was recently diagnosed with an aggressive form of melanoma in his lungs. Sam's doctors have recommended both immunotherapy and chemotherapy treatments given the stage and growth of his cancer, but they are concerned that insurance will not cover both treatments. Our family wants Sam to have all medically recommended treatments available to him, so we are raising money to help pay the out-of-pocket costs for treatments insurance does not cover. Additionally, any money raised will go toward supplementing Sam's income, since he has already used significant time off during a two-week stay in the hospital and will need further time away from work for treatment. Everyone looks for a way to help in a time of crisis - myself included - and the reality is that monetary donations are a massive help. Sam and Lauren are not the type of people to ask for money, but they are in an impossible situation. Any amount would be greatly appreciated, particularly from me who is just trying to find some way to support her brother. Thank you!!! Katie Norton",Raised $550 from 5 donations

Dorothy’s Cancer Treatment,"$2,525 raised of $10,000 goal","Hi, my name is Katie Price and I’m trying to raise money for my mom Dorothy Snider. She has had cancer three times in the last five years and was just diagnosed for the fourth time. She has a very rare form of viral cancer that is incurable and is extremely aggressive. Dorothy is recently divorced and is currently on disability with a severely limited income. Her cancer will require her to undergo six to eight sessions of chemotherapy over the next 18-24 weeks. We are also planning on having her undergo additional reviews and screenings at another cancer center to ensure she is getting the best possible treatment to try and fight this!

For those that don’t know Dorothy, she is a loving mom of four adult children and has three young grandchildren. She uprooted her life nine years ago to move closer to her aging parents and ill sister to help take care of them. This move took her away from three of her four children as well as her only grandchild at that time. Dorothy is always willing to do whatever she can for her family. I’m Dorothy’s oldest child and the first six years of my life it was just me and my mom. She scraped by taking care of a baby all on her own. After that she remarried and had three additional children. Times were always tight for us, but Dorothy ensured that we never knew how bad it was. She always made sure we had birthday parties and would do fun things for the different holidays. Christmas was the most magical time growing up. Dorothy would decorate a big tree, have tons of cookies, and she somehow managed to get all four of her kids the top items from their wishlist every year. Some of the traditions I grew up with are things that I’ve carried with me through life and am now passing on to my own children.

Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is one of the most common and consequential infectious diseases of cats around the world. In infected cats, FIV attacks the immune system, leaving the cat vulnerable to many other infections. This has caused Midnight's cancer to be more aggressive.

Treatment/Avoid Leg Loss COMPLETE,"$6,475 raised of $6,475 goal","In September of 2013 I broke my ankle on both sides and have since had 5 separate surgeries. During these surgeries (I suspect) I first obtained two common versions of staph infections which were treated with out-of-pocket funds with IV antibiotics through a built in PICC line (built in IV ports in my arm). The cost per week for the first 6 weeks of treatment ranged from $350 per week to $560 per week...all out of pocket. This does not include the hospital, surgeon, lab and anesthesiologist bills. I now have another infection in my ankle (and bone), Pseudomonas, that is more dangerous and much more expensive to treat at a whopping $1400 per week (I may need to update this number after making a few phone calls). At the current time I am paying hospital prices and spending 6 hours plus drive time each day to come to the emergency room for treatments twice a day that last 3 hours each time. I have to bring my 9-year old from 8 - 11 pm each evening (every other week) on school nights and at 8 am plus evenings on the weekends (which is past her bedtime and very hard on her). My goal is to raise enough to transition to home health care for IV antibiotic delivery to my home and the care of a home health care nurse so I can avoid losing my company/career and keep life as normal as possible for my family.

In addition, I would like to pay back as quickly as possible the personal loans my family have helped me with to make sure I can get these critical daily medications which will save my leg and my life.

I will be forever grateful and appreciative of any support received. I will have my mom manage the funds to set up the direct treatment payments and if you provide your mailing address I will send a personal letter by mail to each donor.

Much love and respect,

We are reaching out to you in desperate need of your help to fund a life-saving treatment plan.
Tasha's journey with health difficulties began in 2001 when she was diagnosed with a Desmoid Tumor in her right chest wall and ribs. Despite the tumor being inoperable and its challenging location, the oncologist team managed to shrink it to just 1 mm through radiation treatment. However, the potential side effects of the treatment raised concerns about her ability to have children. Against all odds, Tasha is now happily married and blessed with three wonderful boys, aged 14, 12, and 10, who have brought immeasurable joy to her life. Their presence is a testament to Tasha's unyielding faith in God, who has been her guiding light throughout this journey.

Cancer Treatment Surgery,"$10,040 raised of $15,000 goal","I’m creating this fundraiser to help cover the medical expenses for my husband Woody Horn. 
As most of you know, he has been battling Stage 4 Pancreatic Cancer. Chemotherapy has been taxing on him but it is working. Today we received the most incredible news. Woody is now eligible for a potentially life saving surgery- The Nanoknife. 
This surgery will take place in Florida with a highly specialized surgeon. We will be in Florida for at least 1 week and will have travel expenses as well. 
The surgeon is pushing to schedule this surgery in about 2 weeks. We are looking at up to $15000 out of pocket upfront .
I have been the only one working as he has been unable to and I will be off work at minimum 1.5 weeks and I do not have any vacation time available to help. 

The statistics with pancreatic cancer are typically very grim. My husband has been fighting so hard to beat this. This surgeon has a less than 4% reoccurrence rate- meaning this surgery could literally save his life. 
We are very blessed to have such a wonderful community behind us and appreciate any help we can get as this news was unexpected but incredible.

Melissa's Cancer Treatment,"$3,556 raised of $10,000 goal","My sister-in-law, Melissa is in desperate need of financial assitance.  In 2007 she was diagnosed with Myelofibrosis and Myelodyplastic Syndrome, two forms of cancer which have since progressed to Mixed Lineage Leukemia.  Initially, she was given a 5 year prognosis, and thankfully her sister was a 10/10 match for stem cell transplant.  For the past eleven years the doctors have watched and waited for the syndrome to progress to its current stage...the stage at which she would need the stem cell transplant.  Unfortunately, the time is now, and her insurance and employment are no longer viable.  

Melissa Nichols Krulac does not qualify for Medicare and will need to pay Cobra for herself, her young son and my brother (her husband). This is near impossible as Melissa has lost her job, as of today, August 21, 2017.  

Her treatment is scheduled for September 2017.  Once the surgery is complete, she will be quarantined for 100 days, in an apartment five miles from the hospital.  Due to her illness and compromised immune system, neither her son nor husband can live with her during this time.  

Without this transplant, Melissa's prognosis is one year.  

The funds we are seeking are for Cobra insurance, rent (for the in-town apartment), transportation to and from the hospital, prescriptions for recovery, food and living expenses.  

As a contractor, her husband's job will not allow for any paid time off, which will interfere will hospital visits and care.

The funds they are seeking will keep Melissa insured and safe while she recovers, as well as paying for whatever expenses her family finds necessary for day to day living.

Please keep my family in your prayers, as we know any little bit of positivity is helpfull in this difficult journey.

Thank you and God bless you and yours.

Sarah's Medical Treatment,"$2,144 raised of $5,000 goal","My friend Sarah is a rehabilitation counselor who works to help people with mental health illness. She's helped many professionals and families with loved ones who have mental illness find hope in recovery.  Now she needs our help.

She was recently diagnosed with Chronic Toxic Encephalopathy, Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) because of a prolonged toxic mold exposure, and soft lesions on her brain from an acute traumatic brain injury. She is constantly fighting sepsis . Her body is so toxic that even the smallest of dangers go directly to her brain. When that happens, her muscles contract which makes her hands, arms and legs twist painfully. Then she stops breathing. 

She is so sensitive to mold that it's like a severe peanut allergy. 90% of the buildings in the area of traces of mold in their air conditioning systems. Over the past year she's lost count of how many times she's stopped breathing (grocery store, church, DMV, post office, lab to get a blood draw, imaging facility,  and work. Over Labor Day weekend her toxicity got so bad that she had difficulty breathing in the car after getting take-out tacos.

Her symptoms come and go  depending on what's in the air, food and how much energy she uses.  

She's working hard to follow doctor's orders. In many ways she's made lots of progress. They finally know what's wrong and how to help her, but financially the hospital says, ER visits, blood work and medication to get her to this point have drained family finances.  It’s impossible to continue treatment.  

Treatment includes:

• Medications to bind to the mold toxins, specialized antibacterial and antifungal nasal spray to reduce the toxic load. Each medicine much be obtained through a compounding pharmacy so that it doesn't have ingredients that trigger the toxic encephalopathy). ($286-414/monthly)

• Weekly IV therapy & injections to heal the blood-brain-barrier. ($80 monthly)

• Supplements to heal the gut lining and address toxic encephalopathy (aprox $140/month)

• Specialized diet ($125/month)

• Monthly changing of Air filters for both the HVAC and HEPA purifiers in the house ($120/month)

• Copays and patient responsibility for lab work and doctor appointments ($220 monthly + 20% of blood work costs)

• Infrared sauna (Online home options ranges anywhere from $180-1500)

• Staying in a temperature-controlled environment with air filtration so as not to expend too much energy ($365/month while using medical equipment 24/7).

She and her sweetheart have worked hard to stay afloat during what must feel like an unending barrage of new developments. She lost her full-time job due to deteriorating health.

She's forever grateful family and the Church’s humanitarian program for all the ongoing support in so many ways we cannot adequately express our gratitude. She's embarrassed to request more help, she  cannot continue medical treatment without assistance.  All funds raised here will go directly to Sarah and David and will cover three months of medical treatment. 

She longs for the day when she can enter any building without becoming paralysed and stop breathing. She wants return to inspiring mental health professionals and people with mental illness in the recovery journey.

JC's Cancer Treatment Expenses,"$12,180 raised of $12,000 goal","Hi, my name is Toni. I'm raising funds on behalf of my bff and housemate of 20 years, Joncliff. Last year he was diagnosed with Giant Cell Tumors of the Bone in his left leg and despite his insurance delaying diagnosis and treatment, surgery was successful in saving his leg. X-rays in January showed no signs of any further tumors and we were hopeful we had this thing beat.

However, he recently started coughing up blood and has been in and out of the hospital for the past week. The tumors are back in force and this time in both of his lungs. His oncologist wants to get him started on treatments ASAP to reduce the number and size of the tumors to the point that the remainder can be removed surgically.

Coco Puff needs treatment for her rare illness,"$1,515 raised of $12,000 goal","Hi Everyone!

My beloved pup, Coco Puff, has been diagnosed with diabetes and cataracts. Without immediate care, her sight could continue to deteriorate until she's unable to see. To keep this from happening, she requires a procedure that is extremely expensive and has a goal of raising $12,000.
This got me thinking about how our animal companions are just as vulnerable to health issues as we are and deserve the same amount of care and consideration. This experience inspired me to go further with the goal of this Gofundme page.

Banjos Vet Fees and Treatment,"$1,532 raised of $5,000 goal","Hi, my name is Mallory. I adopted my dog Banjo last July (2022) and he has recently developed some pretty serious medical issues. A little over a week ago (May 21st) he started having issues with weakness in his back legs and was originally treated at his primary vet for a back injury. He then started to develop a wet cough and regurgitation. When I went back to his primary vet they ruled out any broken bones or torn ligaments and decided that it was most likely neurological. I set up an appointment with the only neurologist in KY for June 27th. But last night (June 1st) his cough was getting worse and I ended up taking him to Metro (MVSE) around 5am. They ran a bunch of blood work and did x-rays of his chest and esophagus. They have come to the conclusion that he has something called Myasthenia Gravis, where his esophagus is enlarged and loses the ability to move food through it. This puts him at risk of pneumonia. He has lost most of his reflex to swallow. They’ve started him on some antibiotics and immunosuppressants. They are keeping him overnight and want to keep him until they’ve seen significant improvement of his swallowing. Our current quote is $1,800-$2,200, which includes all of the tests they’ve done and one overnight stay. The likely hood of him needing to stay more than one night is high, meaning the price will continue to increase.

Offset the financial cost during Cancer treatment,"$1,975 CAD raised of $10,000 goal","Hi my name is Amanda, and I am starting the fundraiser to go towards medical costs, and the cost of living during this time for my mother that will be undergoing treatment for Breast Cancer, she has been diagnosed with Inflamatory Breast Cancer. She will be going through 4-6 months chemo and radiation, as well as surgery.

While she is off work, I am fundraising to be able to help with monthly bills, groceries, and the day to day requirements. My dad will be working but like most people today, one income is not enough to pay the bills. Any donations are greatly appreciated.

My parents have always done everything they can to help support our family, and its always hard to admit when we need help, but things will not be easy this next year. She needs to be able to focus on this fight and not have to worry about anything financially if possible. As the saying goes, ""It takes a village,"" will ring true during this time.

Stem Cell Therapy To Help Gary Walk,"$4,554 raised of $27,000 goal","Together, let’s disrupt mainstream medicine. Stem cell therapy can improve the lives of many people including those with devastating injuries like our Dad, Gary Miller who suffered a tragic accident in 2021. A spinal cord injury left him as a paraplegic. Through multiple surgeries and weekly physical rehabilitation at NextStep in Orlando he made astounding strides in his strength, but still cannot feel his legs. Stem cell therapy is cutting edge and research based proven to give hope to those that have lost it. Let’s be clear, Gary is a bad a** and doesn’t want your sympathy, he wants to walk again. He was born and raised in Detroit, MI and served in the military overseas from 1976-1979. After which, he earned a living building homes, churches, hotels, restaurants, pubs and more. His life has been dedicated to physical strength and endurance. Sitting in a chair will not due for this 67 year old stud. The barrier to recovery is the location and cost of treatment. Like most alternative medical advances, the most effective stem cell therapy has been stalled for approval in the states. Mexico provides an excellent treatment program but with a high price tag. Hence, why we are calling out to our community to help fund his therapy. Together we can not only help our Dad walk again, we can also support the research behind stem cell therapy and push a movement in the U.S for lawmakers and medicine.

Sam's Leukemia Treatments,"$1,866 raised of $17,000 goal","Dear friends, family, and kind-hearted individuals,

I hope this message finds you well. Today, I am reaching out to you with a heavy heart to share the story of my roommate, Sam. Recently, she received the devastating news that she has been diagnosed with leukemia. Sam is an hourly worker so with her loss of wages from being in the hospital as well as the significant costs of her treatment, the financial burden has become overwhelming for Sam and her family.

Sam has been a Waffle House short-order cook for the past ten years, with Rockstar status at her job having cooked over $3 million worth of food. She's also an artist with a deep interest in video games, and science fiction and fantasy stories. She loves animals, particularly dogs. Her hospital room is full of dinosaur and Pokemon plushies. She loves Jane Austen, watching the 90's BBC Pride and Prejudice series at least once a year (multiple times in a month). She is a loving, supportive wife to David and a caring, encouraging mother to their 11 year old daughter Emily. She's been a pillar of emotional strength through the trials of the past few years, emotional, medical, and financial. She's a supportive and giving friend, showing whatever support she can to the people close to her. Her advice is blunt and to-the-point but always given from a place of caring. She truly is a rock that can be leaned on in the either the best or worst of times. Sam is a remarkable person who has always been there for others in times of need, and we love her very very much. Now, it is our turn, as her community, to rally around her and provide the support she desperately needs as she has always and will always do for any one of us.

Chemo and Radiation Therapy,"$715 raised of $1,500 goal","Hi, most of you know me, I am Erik aka 803EP. As you probably know, I had a battle with kidney cancer earlier this year in which I had my left kidney completely removed. All was well and life was finally getting back on track until last week. I had a standard every 3 month follow up visit and they did blood work and a CT scan to make sure everything was healed properly etc. Everything from the previous surgery looked great, but there was a problem as well. The scan revealed a tumor on my left hip/pelvis area (same side as the kidney), the oncologist viewed it closely and then my bloodwork confirmed I have a very high ALP (alphaline phosphate) level. Bottom line is that the cancer that was in my kidney developed a new tumor, or there may have already been a small tumor there that was overlooked during the focus on my kidney. I now have what they are calling Stage 3 Bone Cancer, the stages are based upon the size of the tumor. Unlike my kidney I can't just go have my hip removed so I have to go through the chemo/radiation therapy to treat it this time. I really hate even typing this and having to ask for your help again but I don't have many options. A 6 week treatment session costs about $30,000. I do have insurance, they pay 80%, however they require a deposit before they will authorize treatment when it comes to big expenses like this. Hekc, I am still paying on the 20% of my kidney surgery and now faced with a new battle.

Elizabeth Luna medical bills and recovery,"€5,565 raised of €15,000 goal","Hi, my name is Manuel and I am fundraising for Ibette Elizabeth Luna Delgado. She was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Type T on July 4th, 2023. She had a very quick response to the first treatment, the PETHEMA 2019 protocol from the PETHEMA group. Unfortunately, she recently had an infiltration of leukemic cells in the central nervous system while fighting against the Sars-CoV-2 virus. This infiltration was diagnosed on November 22nd, 2023. She started receiving a stronger treatment for the relapse of the disease. Due to having 250,000 leukocytes per microliter of blood, where the doctors say part of it are leukemic cells, she started to receive personalized treatment breaking the protocol. Right now, she is recovering from the intense treatment she received, accommodating her bone marrow for a possible transplant. We are opening this fundraising to get funds for these hard times and to get a treatment called T-ALL multi CART therapy from Dr. Lung-Ji Chang. Her current treatment has been individualized and we are waiting to see if there is any bone marrow donor. Because we don’t have the donor, it is important to get funds for the T-ALL multi CART therapy, which is not even available in Spain and neither accessible by any organization.

Blade’s medical bills,"$551 raised of $2,000 goal","Many people have had the blessing of knowing our sweet kitty Blade. He’s always looking for a nap buddy, loves other animals, and comforts everyone around him. On Sunday morning we could tell something wasn’t right with him and we rushed him over to the pet hospital in Atascadero. The doctor then told us if he didn’t receive treatment that day he would be at a very high risk of dying.
We explained his symptoms (trouble urinating, blood in urine, excessive meowing, panting, and fatigue) to the doctor, and shortly after were provided with a diagnosis. According to the veterinarian, Blade had accumulated a large amount of struvite bladder stones, causing his urethra to be fully blocked.
The doctor then throughly explained the treatment process and gave us a estimate for the cost of his treatment. The total cost of his treatment including aftercare medications, a three day stay at the hospital, and check-ups is totaling at $2000. We were originally given an estimate of $2500, which included cultures of the struvite bladder stones and other tests, but due to our financial status we decided to hold off on the extra measure and just get the procedure taken care of.

Medical funds needed ASAP to continue treatment,"$4,725 raised of $5,000 goal","Hi Friends and Family -

We are in urgent need of help for my cousin, Genesis Quitalig in the Philippines. He was admitted to the hospital on October 5th for pain and fever and was soon after diagnosed with Malaria. The Malaria was treated, but he was still facing intense pain and symptoms. The issue with the Philippine hospital system is they will not proceed with any tests or diagnoses nor will they release a patient until payments have been cleared. My family in the Philippines lives in poverty and could not afford the hospital bills while the symptoms continued to get worse (a catch-22 in terms of racking up hospital bills, but unable to release my cousin). After several weeks in the hospital, they have found abscesses within his liver. The delay in diagnoses was a result of my family not being able to pay the hospital bills in real-time. My family in the US has cleared the first round of balances up until this point, but we are still outstanding of over $3,500. The latest issue with his liver will result in at least 2-3 more weeks of hospitalization. We are attempting to move my cousin to another hospital that will be able to treat him sooner (as most hospitals are overrun with COVID-19 patients), but we must clear the outstanding balance while it simultaneously continues to grow everyday. We anticipate that the next few weeks will also come with heavy bills that his family simply cannot afford. Any help with getting his existing medical bills cleared will enable us to get him released from the current hospital and into the right one where he can receive the treatment he needs. The rest of the proceeds will ensure that my cousin does not face any more delays in future treatment as he battles this unpredictable fight and hopefully provides a little bit of cushion to get him comfortable once released.

“Miles of Love: Shelly’s Cancer Treatment Fund,"$815 raised of $5,000 goal","Hello family, friends, and supporters, thank you for gathering here today. We stand united in support of a remarkable woman named Shelly Grekon, who has faced more challenges and overcome greater odds than most of us can fathom. Twenty-four years ago, at the young age of 24, Shelly was diagnosed with Ewings Sarcoma, a rare and devastating form of cancer. With incredible courage, she fought her battle and had to undergo the amputation of her leg below the knee. Despite this life-altering setback, Shelly emerged victorious and remained cancer-free for the next 24 years. During those years, Shelly's love and dedication were bestowed upon her daughter, 17 year old Alex Wyant whom she had with her loving, supportive fiancé Daryl Wyant. Shelly's limited physical abilities never hindered her commitment to providing a nurturing and supportive environment for her daughter. The bond between Shelly and Alex is unbreakable, and Alex has become Shelly's driving force, her motivation to conquer any adversity that comes her way. However, life had another challenge in store for Shelly. In October of 2022, she received a diagnosis of (MpBC) Metaplastic Breast Cancer, a rare and aggressive subtype of Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). Due to its rarity and unique characteristics, Metaplastic Breast Cancer often requires specialized treatment to better understand its behavior. Shelly endured grueling rounds of chemotherapy treatments from Taxotere, Carboplatin and Keytruda.  Incredibly, she achieved a Pathological Complete Response (pCR), with the invasive cancer disappearing from her breast. But this victory came at a price. During her treatment, while taking the medication Keytruda, it unfortunately led to a rare but life-threatening condition known as myocarditis, which occurs in only 1% of the patients on Keytruda. Her heart was engulfed in raging inflammation, a crisis that coincided with her cancer remission. Shelly's resilience prevailed once more as she underwent a three-hour operation to have four stents placed in her arteries, correcting her heart condition. She emerged as a survivor once again. Now, Shelly faces yet another uphill battle. She must undergo 25 rounds of radiation treatments to ensure a complete recovery. The daily trips to the hospital for these treatments pose a significant financial burden on Shelly and her family. This is where our collective support and generosity become invaluable. Today, we gather to launch a fundraising campaign to assist Shelly in her journey towards healing. The funds raised will be instrumental in covering her car maintenance costs, enabling her to travel back and forth to the hospital for her radiation treatments. By contributing, each one of us has the power to make a meaningful difference in Shelly's life. Shelly's story embodies resilience, strength, and an unwavering spirit that refuses to yield to life's most difficult challenges. Let us come together, inspired by her indomitable will, to provide the support she needs. Every donation, big or small, is a step towards ensuring Shelly's well-being and easing the financial strain that accompanies her medical journey. Together, we can lift the weight of financial worries from Shelly's shoulders, allowing her to focus on what truly matters: healing, cherishing her daughter, and embracing a future filled with hope. Your generosity today will have a lasting impact on Shelly's life, and it will serve as a testament to the incredible strength of the human spirit. Thank you for your compassion, your support, and your unwavering commitment to making a difference in Shelly's life. Let us rally around her with love, kindness, and the belief that together, we can overcome any obstacle.

Martin is already in a weakened state from the surgery and we don’t know how much his body can withstand these debilitating side effects from chemo. The doctors say that chemotherapy is not a cure – it is merely an attempt to extend his life. But at what cost? 

 
Embracing chemo would also mean he would have to be tethered to UCSF in San Francisco, CA, receiving treatments every two to three weeks, perhaps for the rest of his life.
 
Is it worth enduring the devastating side effects and a massively-compromised life to buy a possible extra few months, maybe a year, possibly two (a longshot)?
 
Martin is choosing quality of life over quantity. His wish is to return to our home, where he can live his final days surrounded by the warmth of the sun and beloved friends/family, and to receive treatments that will support his body and spirit, boost his immune system, and perhaps even give him a longer more vital life. While  there, Martin will have access to world-class healers at a fraction of the cost of the US.
 
Though his body is still weak, Martin’s spirit and humor still shine brightly.  
 
He has hope to live this final part of his life in an empowered versus debilitated way.
 
He longs to LIVE...on his own terms.
 
But he cannot do this on his own. 
 
Your caring generosity will support Martin’s treatments and enable him to focus on the quality of his life versus finances.
 
Please support my hero in being his own hero in this last part of his life. 
 
Please donate now. 
 
With deep appreciation and heartfelt gratitude,
Debra (and Martin)

Roger is a retired racing greyhound Roger has a loving home and is very much loved unfortunately Roger is having a few problems with his teeth and this is proving to be very expensive Rogers dad only works part time so as you can imagine a vet bill of £750/£800 is a big worry, roger is insured BUT Unfortunately it does not cover dental treatment .although roger needs to have this treatment to ensure he does not suffer with painful teeth and that it does not lead to other complications.

Kendra's fight against breast cancer,"$3,740 CAD raised of $8,000 goal","Hi
My daughter, Kendra was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. I am asking for help on her behalf for the cost of a consult and treatment from a naturopathic oncologist. This dual action approach would enhance her conventional treatment and greatly increase her long term odds. The cost of the initial visit is $270.
Here's an idea of treatments offered and examples of costs. It does include nutritional guidance and suppliments but its so much more than that. Different intravenous therapies are offered which would vary in price from 100-250 dollars per treatment. Vitamin c infusions for example, help with inflammation as well as strengthening the immune system. Another example of treatments offered is hyperthermia treatment. The cost for this is $475.00 per treatment. Hyperthermia is a type of treatment to help damage and kill cancer cells with little or no harm to normal tissue and also has been proven to help chemotherapy work better.

Get Leonie to Russia for treatment,"$2,375 AUD raised of $50,000 goal","My beautiful friend Leonie (the lovely lady on the right) was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis a few years ago and as her condition slowly worsens the most annoying thing is to know that there is advanced medical treatment, just not in Australia.... Please help us raise the money to get Leonie to Russia where they have a proven treatment that stops this debilitating disease using advanced Stem Cell Treatment.  The total cost will be approximately $100k, it is really a small price to pay for what will give Leonie her life back, but it is an expensive treatment.

Any donations would be greatly appreciated.

Please Help My Dad Hes Fighting Cancer Like A Rock,"$1,660 raised of $10,000 goal","Please bear with me I've never done this before. To be honest I almost don't know how to form the words to tell you how hard the last several years have been. As I'm writing this I'm sitting in the exact spot in my home where my Dad told me he had Prostate Cancer... feels different now. My Dads name is Jerry and he raised me as a single father. It's pretty much just always been me and him. He's a Georgia Boy Go Dawgs hah, He'd like that I wrote that... he's a dork. He's also a Veteran and the most hard working, resourceful, goofy, lively, and toughest person I know. He's been like a Gladiator fighting all my life to provide the best most normal life for me as he could. Working 50 sometimes 60 hour weeks just to make sure I never went without what I needed. And he never complained. I've lost count of the sacrifices he's made for me and all the hours spent together laughing and carrying on as though we weren't always up against some kind of struggle. He's been a tremendous Father, Son, Brother, and Friend to the people in his life, and at this time in my life the closest family I have. The last several years as I'm sure a lot of people can relate have seen some big loss. Suddenly I looked around and felt more alone than ever, but there was my Dad smile on his face, dad jokes at hand, and a fight in him that I'm constantly astonished by. Its been 5 years battling Cancer and he's never complained and never waivered. He's had intensive surgery, hormone treatments, radiation and chemo. All of this he's gone through while still working as much as possible. I live with him and try to help in any and every way I can. Though he still makes more than me, I have tried to help him financially as much as possible. All of these treatments cost so much money, along with the day-to-day meds he takes. And of course, the Insurance only covers as little as they can get away with. Chemo has been hard on him and this new treatment has made going to work regularly more difficult. He can't really work as much and when he tries I'm afraid it hinders his healing. Though at his strong request, we've tried to create as normal a day-to-day as possible for him throughout this experience I know and see its taken its toll as it does for anyone in his situation. He's had to spend his savings and huge portions of his retirement to pay for not just the treatments but everyday expenses because of the cost of the work missed. I don't know how much longer he can keep this up and I'm unable to pitch in as much as I once was. Hopefully that will change as soon as possible, but in the meantime he needs help that I hate to say I can't provide now. I've created this GoFundMe page to ask with all sincerity that anyone whose able to can help me to help my dad. ANY and ALL donations will go straight to him to take some of this pressure and stress off of him for his treatments and the everyday things. Life doesn't just stop when a person gets sick with anything... Things still come up and need to get done. Making ends meet should never be something anyone in his situation should have to worry about. I know people often say life isn't fair and I've seen that truth first hand all my life, but my heart is breaking more everyday because I'm so tired of seeing my Dad get the short end of the stick. Its not fair and I'm hoping maybe I can change that with the help of those who might understand what's it like and are able to help. My Dad means the world to me and though he'll be the first to tell you he's had a good life and has no complaints, he's gone through a lot and is a very strong and brave man. He's been very fortunate in his life to have a good outlook on things and luck that gets him through most things, but sometimes everyone just needs a little help ya know. I would appreciate so deeply any donations that can be made. I understand there are a lot of people out there who are struggling too, it's always on my mind. My Dad was the one who taught me generosity and compassion, that there are always people in need and if you have the ability to help, you have the responsibility to help... that's my Dad for ya. Again thank you to everyone that even takes the time to read this let alone share it or donate to someone who maybe you don't know or haven't seen in a million years. Time moves way too fast man, and I'm just trying to hold on to as much of it with my Dad as I can. Please everyone out there be safe and hopeful --- Crystal P.

Help for medical treatment,"$7,660 raised of $5,000 goal","Hello, my name is Laura and I am fundraising on behalf of my brother, Tom. In recent years he has developed a debilitating skin condition causing constant pain and itching resulting in open sores, hair loss, and limited mobility. Doctors have not been able to diagnose the problem. And the endless list of solutions he has tried has yet to help.

Going on 4 years now and working with a new doctor (with whom he is starting to make progress) it is now highly recommended that he receive a 30 day treatment plan known as Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy. Unfortunately at a price of $5000.

The reason I am reaching out and asking for help is because Tom also suffers from a chronic lung disease, cystic fibrosis, causing infertility. He and his wife have been trying to save money in an adoption fund in order to be able to start a family. Now these unforeseen medical issues and the new treatment cost have them feeling hopeless. Not being able to save for a family or afford to get the right treatment for Tom.

"Medical, prescription, & Travel Expenses","$1,160 raised of $30,000 goal","Hi, my name is Ashley and I’m fundraising for Lyme Disease. I was diagnosed with Lyme, back on April 2023. Since then I’ve become unhealthy from many complications associated with Lyme. I’m a temporarily disabled single mom at the moment and trying to care for a 5 year old. Insurance hasn’t covered most my medical bills or prescriptions and has put me in a financial bind to even continue the care I need associated from this disease. I have had to travel to Chicago for all my care, which is a two hour drive. Hotels, gas, tolls, and child care has added up just for me, in order to attend my numerous appointments needed. I am not only battling Lyme disease at this point, as it has done so much damage to me. I’m now battling, heart, lung, respiratory, sinus, nerve, high blood pressure, diabetes, vision, and hearing issues caused by the Lyme. The longer I go without the proper care and treatments, the worse off I’m going to get and it spreads fast. I have to see doctors that are not covered by insurance and take medication that is not covered for more than 3 weeks. I have exhausted all financial options at this point and I need to swallow my Pride and ask my family and friends for help. It’s all becoming too much on me, especially my little girl. She just wants her mommy to be healthy and happy. If you can’t donate momentarily, please consider any other options you feel will help my family. The funds will be used to cover travel accommodations, prescriptions, and medical treatment. Thank you and God Bless.

Brilinta Prescription,"$6,533 raised of $5,000 goal","Hi my name Angela and my husband Richard had a massive heart attack on August 10, 2022. His widow maker was 100% blocked and he is extremely fortunate to have survived. He never complains about anything on a serious note but the day after purchasing a new car he woke up at 4:25 am expressing extreme pain in his chest. If you know Richard he is very lighthearted and has the best sense of humor so my first reaction was should I call 911? When he said yes I knew it was serious. After calling 911 the first time and putting our little monster away there was that moment where my husband said the pain was too much for him to bear and then he said the words you really don't see coming.....I don't think I'm going to make it"". Oh no you didn't just say that.... I grabbed his cheeks slapped em a little and said I'm sorry but that is not an option. At this point it had been 10 min since the 911 call and all the lights and doors were open so they knew who called them. I called again in a panic. It took 3 very long minutes after that to hear the sirens. He never opened his eyes while on the gurney but he remembers me rubbing his feet while putting the heart monitors on him. By the time I got to the hospital and they gave me the run around I knew something was not right. He went in to full cardiac arrest at the hospital and were taking life saving measures while I waited in a cath lab for any information. When the female nurse finally came out to the waiting room she was drenched in sweat and said we saved him and now I can take my kids to the first day of school.

What do we do: We provide an activity cart for the waiting rooms in the Emergency Department and clinic with coloring sheets, puzzles, magazines, and other activities for patients and their families. We operate a Coffee Cart in the Emergency Department waiting room and the in-patient units.  The Coffee Cart is equipped with freshly brewed coffee and hot water for tea and hot chocolate.  It also has cups, sugar, and creamer. We make each individual cup to the specifications of the person and it is completely free for them.

How you can help: The Coffee Cart is based solely on donations.  Our goal is to raise $5,000 to fund three Coffee Cart runs on each of our bi-weekly visits for an entire year. Donors can fund one run with a gift of $60, two runs with a gift of $120, or three runs with a gift of $180. A gift of any amount is extremely helpful to these families and is greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance for your contribution to this cause that means so much to all those that are touched by the teams of volunteers and dogs.




Established 2008




The Pet Prescription Team (PPT) founded The Faith Dog Project in memory of Brielle Murray and her dog Faith.  Brielle and Faith were members of the PPT and wholeheartedly represented what the PPT was all about, “Healing Hearts Through Pets.” 

 In 2008, Brielle Murray was diagnosed with Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) which is a cancerous tumor that develops in the body's soft tissues, usually the muscles. It can affect the head, neck, bladder, arms and legs. Cells from these tumors are often fast growing and can spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body. Brielle's tumor started within the ear canal. During the next three years she would undergo multiple surgeries, Radiation, Chemo treatments and a Stem Cell transplant. Sadly, Brielle passed away from us on February 18, 2011, but not before she saw her dream become a reality.



It was Brielle’s wish that children with cancer who were in the hospital and were visited by the PPT would receive stuffed dogs to keep them company after the PPT volunteers left. Through The Faith Project, “Faith Dogs” are given to the patients that the team members visit.  PPT began with the oncology patients at Kaiser Hospital in Los Angeles and hope to spread the project to all areas that they visit.



With each dog, we share Brielle's story and her inspiring words, ""With Faith, All Things Are Possible."" With each hug the dog receives, each tear it catches, and each moment of pain that it absorbs, Brielle's hand and Faith's paw will continue to imprint their prayers and love to those who need it most.


Founded 2012


In 2012, The Pet Prescription Team started a program called; “There’s No Place Like Home.” This projects goal, as well as vision, is extremely clear. To take the time and energy to create a relaxing atmosphere for a less fortunate resident/patient by giving them a room make over.  We not only help them to pick up their scattered belongings, we transform their room into a place they feel comfortable in. We do this by talking to the patient, getting to know their likes and interests and from there we purchase items and make over their rooms to make them feel more at “home,”  leaving a lasting impression on their lives.

In 2014, we expanded this project to include children’s hospital rooms and outreaches to families in need of support by providing items for long term care during hospice care and in home care. This project also includes providing special events for oncology patients. This project not only recognizes the patients struggle but acknowledges the families difficulties during a time of illness.

Medical and prescription medicine,"$3,575 raised of $30,000 goal","Hi my name is Tony. I have been working at St. Helena school and church for many years of my life . I have met a lot of good people throughout my life, but there is one special teacher, Lynne Soltys, who has had to retire early for medical reasons. She has been teaching our children for over 45 years and has been a friend and mentor to many of us. Now, she needs us and it’s our turn to help her! Many of the medical expenses that she is incurring for her prescriptions and home health aids are not covered under her health benefits. So, family and friends, it is time to give back to one of the greatest teachers St Helena School has ever had. LET’S GO FAMILY AND FRIENDS! Even if it’s a dollar; let’s help out in any way we can.
Lynne Soltys has been a part of our community most of her life and she continues to be a member of our St. Helena family.","Roselle, NJ"
Prescriptions and after care,"$550 raised of $2,500 goal","Hey all,
I am reaching out to you all for your help. After a long conversation with Adolfo he has given me permission to create this GoFundMe. As you might know he's not one to ask for anything and in any case he always prefers to help than to be helped.
It's been a very hard time for Adolfo these last 2 years. He's been from all types of doctors to many different hospitals trying to figure out what has him feeling sick all the time. He was admitted to Inova Hospital last week and finally got to come home Wednesday. He was treated for the swelling on his body specially his legs. The doctors discharged him still in need of more tests that he will need to get done during his follow up appointments. They believe there is something wrong with his kidneys because he is secreting large amounts of protein through his urine. Test results indicate there is no kidney damage so they are still trying to figure out the reason. And this is why today I am asking you for your help. He is now on an incredible amount of medicine which some of them his insurance doesn't cover and for others it covers half. The doctors need him to follow through with all the indications. But after finding out how much money we need for his medication this is our alternative to help Adolfo get them. Thank you in advance for ALL YOUR HELP ❤️ Today is also he's birthday and we have him home with us

Medical bills and Prescription food for River,"$300 raised of $3,000 goal","Hi, My name is Katie, My sweet baby River, a lab mix rescue has been very ill the past week. She became lethargic and would not eat. After going to the vet for diagnosis, she was admitted for acute pancreatitis and skyrocketing kidney levels. Amongst caring for my Mom alone, I was the first adult case of Anti- NMDA Encephalitis in NC.

She was ESA certified at the age of 5. She has been with me to chemotherapy, been by my side when no one was.. She loves to swim and visit NC waterfall holes, visit her neighbors, and roll in the sand and cool grass.
Two weeks ago this took a dramatic turn and we were sent to Emergency admission for treatment that included IV fluids, pain meds, and imaging. We also had to travel out of town to get care due to dog flu being rampant where we live. She is home and having out patient treatment, labs, and rx food and medication accompanied with overwhelming costs.

Joe's Medical & Prescription Bills,"$11,918 raised","Our brother and friend has always been one of the most electrifying, vibrant and hilarious curmudgeons on this planet. As many people have said over the years, “God definitely broke the mold after creating Joe.” We all know him for his rough and gruff exterior, but we all also know that inside him is pure gold.

Because Joe was such an incredible athlete, most didn’t know he was . As a result, he’s had , the first when he was twelve. (I still remember the look on my Mother’s face when he returned home from the hospital and she caught him climbing over a cyclone fence to fetch a baseball.)

A botched knee replacement surgery (he’s had seven on each knee) introduced a virus into his bloodstream, which then glommed onto all the metal in his body, including his relatively new artificial heart valve. After degenerating rapidly, he finally fell to the floor of his condo one night, but did manage to call 911 before passing out.

In short, he spent five weeks in various hospitals fighting for his life and had to be med-evacuated to the Cleveland clinic for emergency open-heart surgery, where Doctor's had to remove his valve and both artificial knees. He had an additional surgery this year and is now going into surgery to have his knees put back in. This makes it the third year in a row that he will be spending the holidays in the hospital.

 As a result of all this, Joe hasn’t been able to work for over a year. His medical bills are mounting, his debt is racking up, he can’t afford his medications, and he's too proud to ask for help himself. That’s why we’re asking you to help Joe out. Thank you for your help and support.

"Medical coverage, Prescriptions, Physical Therapy",$320 raised,"Hello, my name is Wayne (44) and I am raising funds to help with the continuation of my medical coverage and prescription costs along with a lengthy recovery I have ahead of me as well as physical therapy. I was diagnosed with having spinal stenosis, Neurogenic claudication with radioculpulthy, and degenerative disc disease. I have bone spurs as well as severe compression on my nerves that affect walking and supporting myself in a upright position for lengthy amounts of time... My last day of work was April 4th of 2022 due to the condition continuing to worsen and be so severe that I could not perform the essential duties that my employer and career require from me. As well as everyday activities and just a normal way of life. Numbness in the legs and chronic lower back pain. I have spent the last two years trying this and that type of conservative treatment trying to avoid surgery at all costs. Chiropractic care, physical therapy, pill after pill trial and error, along with several spinal injections that were a complete failure. I have tried every route imaginable even as to having not 1, not 2, not 3, but 4 options from medical professionals in the spinal surgical field. One physician after the other recommending all the conservative treatments I have tried and listing above. Some offered mental therapy, some offered fusion, others offered minimally invasive surgery. Some offered fully invasive surgery. What to do, what to do??? I finally chose a surgeon in Pittsburgh PA to perform a minimally invasive surgery to help decrease the recovery time as well as my time off from work only to find out that the surgery was unsuccessful and basically I was back to where I started. In extreme pain with no quality of life relapsing back into depressive states of mind wondering if I will ever have relief from this chronic condition I suffer from on a day to day basis. It hurts to walk, it hurts to sit, it hurts to perform the most simplest tasks including showering. I have to sit on a bench to shower. The quality of life ceases to exist for me. I have 3 children who thankfully are all of age and recently became a grandfather for the first time. Recently I received a letter from my employer stating that I will be terminated from my current position on April 5th of 2023 from Saia Motor Freight Co. With whom I have been employed with for almost 3½ years. I love my career choice. I'm passionate about my field, I go over and beyond to help my customers at all times. Even when a delivery is considered to be a curbside dropoff, I cannot with a good conscience just leave somebody's hard earned money/freight be left on the sidewalk. I will if able to drag hundreds of pounds on a pallet into their garage or assist them in unloading the freight as professionally as possible. Some other drivers from other companies would not go that far but I consider myself to have a different type of work ethic. I have abused my body physically over the last 20 years helping family save money performing odd jobs to save them money on labor costs, I have damn near built a house my self that consisted of a shell, I have always worked some type of physically demanding employment. From concrete to an assembly line worker to delivering the United States mail for several years. I decided back in 2018 that I needed to explore new opportunities in a career that I could and would hopefully be able to retire from. I chose to go back to school and pursue my CDL A license and drive a big rig, semi tractor trailer, 18 wheeler. How hard could sitting actually be on some who has broke their body down over the years as I have. Only realizing that my condition would continue to worsen over time and become chronic to the point where I would have to have surgery performed. I drained my 401k to help pay bills while I got the much needed surgery only to find out that it would be unsuccessful and unfortunately I would need a much further invasive surgery (Laminectomy L2-3, L3-4, L4-5) to provide the relief that I search for and need to be able to continue my career as a driver. Unfortunately the time that my company allows to have off has officially came to an end and I will lose my medical insurance and prescription coverage immediately. Just a big sorry it didn't work out. YES. I have been terminated... Thanks a lot. Literally at no fault of my own. I even requested an extension for additional leave time to have my 2nd surgery only to be denied by a company whom I was hoping to retire from. That is not the case. However I was told that I can always reapply once I recover from my procedure. Never did I think I would have to seek employment while recovering from surgery... My surgeon cannot guarantee a specific percentage of how good I will feel from the surgery but it would be in my best interest to have it done. 75%-90% improvement. I'd be happy with a 50% improvement... Will be able to stand for hours and walk for miles. I can't even walk up and down the block at the current moment without having to sit several times. There is plenty of pathology in my medical file that says... Hey. You need surgery and without it, you will never be out of pain. No pills, no magic potions, no amount of weight loss. Just surgical knife and special tools to the spine down to the spinal cord. My pain has caused some relationship issues with the depression and the intolerable amount of pain I am in on any given day wondering when and if it will ever go away or get better. So I ask to all of you if you can help me and my family get through these times of pain and difficulty. It would be greatly appreciated. I will keep everyone posted on my outcome of surgery and the recovery process. I look forward to being able to go back to bowling, throwing darts, walking around amusement parks and just enjoying the simple things that life has to offer.

"Prescriptions, and Medical Bills","$355 raised of $1,500 goal","My name is Justin Wilson. I'm asking for your fund raiser because it's not fair to my family that has to suffer due to my condition. I am in end stage Renal Failure and now on Dialysis. Any and all money that goes to TRYING to keep this disease under control takes even more away from them. I've lost my job, we've lost our home, and we've lost our vehicles. Luckily he parents have us a place to lay our heads for the time being but they aren't doing so well their selves. I'm just asking for some relief so I can afford my medications so my day to day life won't be so tough. Haven't had blood pressure meds in months. And when I can afford some of my meds our family is left with less food and no chance of going out to experience the world. They are my God send! Without them I'd be gone a long time ago. I just want to have a few medications and use the test to show them how much they're truly appreciated. People in their shoes NEVER get the credit they need. Even if it's only enough for one day/ might I could die happy. I should've changed my ""Go Fund Me"" for ""go Fund Them"". For those that have had to give up everything to help someone sick (your life, your money, your personnel space, your time).... you'll understand. Not to mention, one of these heroes is just but 8yrs old. Not ONE SINGLE TIME has he ever complained. He's cried, and wishes his daddy didn't have this disease, but he's the strongest little guy I know! I wish it knew how to put up more pics out videos so you could see the easy he responds to things. But he takes it upon himself to walk me around, open doors, bring food, and even tuck me into bed. So if no one wants to help me. Help my family that's given it up all when they easily could've walken away. Hannah... Luke... I love you both SO MUCH and don't deserve half the love you show me everyday!

Help Ben get the medications he needs,"$860 raised of $5,000 goal","My brother Ben has been suffering for the last 15 years. He has been experiencing every symptom under the sun. At first it was diagnosed as depression and other mental health issues. Over the years his symptoms have gotten worse including nerve pain, neurological symptoms such as dizziness to the point of falling, gastrointestinal, heart and so many other things. He has been to countless doctors, emergency rooms, specialty clincs with no avail. Earlier this year by the grace of God, an aunt in Minnesota was able to help connect us with a specialist in Minnesota. Through many many tests it was discovered that Ben has mold toxicity and chronic Lyme disease, which have been causing all these symptoms for all these years. The doctor is confident in the treatment and medication. However due to being out of state insurance won’t cover the medications. It will cost around $7000 for Ben to receive a 6 month medication treatment on top of the monthly doctor trips to Minnesota. We want nothing more than for him to finally get the help he needs and deserves.","Fort Dodge, IA"

Help getting prescription filled without insurance,"$1,725 raised of $2,000 goal","A few months ago I was having difficulty breathing and my friend took me to an Urgent Care. I feared I had the Covid, instead my lungs were filled with fluid and I was checked into the ER during the scariest of times to go to the hospital. I was in the hospital for over a week. Turned out my liver was not working right and that I had congestive heart failure. I went in uninsured and nervous about how I was going to pay for all of this. I was able to afford my first round of prescription medications thanks to the stimulus check but after my follow up I now need help to pay for the bigger prescription that should last for 3 months. I know times are tight so don't feel bad if you can't help out. I have started paperwork to get help with my healthcare but it's going to take a while to kick in.

Fondaparinux Prescriptions,"$355 raised of $7,500 goal","My name is Kellie and I am 27 weeks pregnant. In week 10 I was admitted to the hospital for 3 weeks with a 2ft long DVT in my left leg. They went in and removed most of it and put me on the blood thinner Heparin. My body rejected that and I was then put on 10mg Fondaparinux injections 1 time a day. This medicine is very expensive and we have used all of our options to keep up with the cost. I have to continue to take this every day all the way through 6weeks after I give birth. cost of this is 3380.00 a month but we started out paying 412.00 a month for the first 2 months with the Gold RX card(our insurance is only covering 1k of the cost) Then last month it went up to 512.00 and now this month it has jumped to 1k. We are asking for the 7500.00 to be able to cover the next 4.5 months as this is a required medicine. My husband works and he makes to much for Medicaid or the 2nd chance Medicaid (We tried that route already). They allow you to make 4k a month with a family of 3(we have a 3 year old little girl as well) He makes 4500.00 so we don't qualify for that option. Also they would want us to pay half the cost of the medicine which is 1690.00 a month so that would not be any better than what we are doing now. Any help is appreciated as I ran out of my last dose on 1/20/24. I can get a 10 day today but I would have to have 425.00 to even get that amount. Thank you for taking the time to read this and if you find it in your heart to help with any dollar amount that would be appreciated. If you would like to donate to here or CashApp or even help with the payment straight at the pharmacy the script is at Albertsons in Longview Texas and if you message us here then we can share whatever info you will need.

Medications for Africa,"$2,765 raised of $5,000 goal","I am Dr. Drew and I am a physician.  I have fallen in love and in so doing want to help care for that love....the people of Tanzania, more specifically the Kibosho region and Kibosho Regional Hospital.

I have gone to Africa several times over the last several decades but this past January 2018, I went to Tanzania, for the first time, with a non-profit college I have been working with, the College of Remote and Offshore Medicine (CoROM).  It was on this trip that I fell in love with the people of Kibosho, Tanzania.  Kibosho sits on the beautiful slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro and is located only 13 kilometers outside of Moshi, one of the major cities in Tanzania, but secondary to limited resources, road conditions, and weather at certain times of the year, it might as well be hundreds of kilometers away.

Kibosho Hospital is growing and has just added on, a three story addition to include a new Emergency Medicine Department, Intensive Care Unit, and Pediatric wards.  This addition is very exciting for them but does not even come close to the level of care that is provided in Europe and in the US, secondary to limited resources such as medications, and durable medical equipment.  Although, with the right resources and funding this level of care could be achieved!

Tanzania, like many of its neighbors, is going through an interesting time in medical care with a sudden increase in severe cardiac disease.  Previously, infectious disease had been so severe that the average lifespan was limited to late forties and early fifties.  Now with the improvement of antibiotics, anti-malarials, and vaccination programs, there has been a drastic improvement in health and the average age is increasing.  These facts, coupled with changes in diet are leading to increased cardiac disease ranging from coronary artery disease, dilated cardiomyopathies, and valvular disease, just to name a few.  Many patients are presenting to Kibosho in severe acute cardiac failure which can have a very high mortality rate, unless identified and treated aggressively early.  Given that they are a resource limited facility and many medications are very hard to get secondary to cost, availability, and need for training, this mortality rate can be even higher.

My area of training is Emergency Medicine and Critical Care, with the majority of my practice currently focused on cardiac patients.  I have vowed to the Chief Medical Officer at Kibosho, Dr. John Materu, to help support, work, and train with the staff at Kibosho Hospital.  Working with CoROM, I plan to return to Kibosho at least twice a year or more.

My goal is to raise money to start to purchase medications that would be critical in the care of these very sick patients.  I would like to then progress on with training, with the ultimate goal, training on ultrasound.  As these machine have become light and relatively inexpensive, they can be ideal to use in a resource limited areas.  I aim to help Dr. Materu, realize the dream of making Kibosho Hospital, known as a Cardiac Center of Excellence.

At this point I would like to raise money for the purchase of medications that they have requested: carvedilol, lisinopril, losartan, furosemide, dobutamine, epinephrine, nitroglycerin, simvistatin, aspirin, clopidogrel.  I will take these medications and equipment with me on each trip.  Then I would start to raise money for the purchase of 3-4 ultrasound machines and set up a training program, to help do early identification and acute management of the very complex patients.  Each machine is at a cost of approximately $2000 USD.

If you have ever been involved with someone you care about that has had any cardiac disease I ask you to consider donating to these happy, life loving people.  We have so much and it would take so little if we all worked together as human beings to care for one another!

Thank you for taking the time to read this!!

Cheers,
Dr. Drew

"Mimi's Medical Bills, Medication, and Recovery","$6,111 raised of $10,000 goal","Hello, my name is Yasir, and I am fundraising for my best friend, Rose Damian, and her beloved dog Mimi.

Mimi is a Dachshund mix prone to IVDD (a spinal injury that can cause paralyzation.) This past weekend, she jumped off the bed because she was excited to see Rose after coming home from work and let out the worst noise she ever heard. Mimi immediately could not use her back legs or bottom half to go to the bathroom. Since no emergency vets accepted patients that night, they scheduled an emergency vet appointment the following morning.

Unfortunately, the doctor was unfamiliar with IVDD and referred them to a specialist at NC State for emergency surgery. They drove that same day and had to put in a $6k deposit for the surgery. This upfront deposit ultimately drained Rose's savings leaving her with no money for further surgeries, hospitalization, or physical therapy. Rose promises to protect and care for Mimi forever as long as she is not in pain but needs our help. Mimi is the only thing that makes Rose's day better.

Karen's MS Medication,"$2,140 CAD raised of $10,000 goal","My friend Karen needs help and she won't ask for it though,  so I will.  You never know when life with throw you a curveball, and Karen was recently thrown a big one. 

Unexpectedly and through no fault of her own, Karen recently lost coverage for medication she MUST must have to lead a healthy life free of the debilitating symptoms of her condition.

About Karen and her Situation

Karen has been living with Multiple Sclerosis for over 14 years and as a result of the illness has been medically retired from her corporate career since 2010. A few months ago she received a notification telling her her employer no longer operated in Canada and that as a result, though she'll still receive her monthly pension income, all her health benefits were being terminated. This is unaffordable for almost any person.

As a result,

Thankfully she may qualify for Ontario's Trillium benefit program which covers up to 80% of her prescription costs. If approved the program doesn't begin until July and after that will still be $800/month!

She has contacted multiple insurance companies, called the pharmaceutical companies that make every med, even contacted her MP- turning over every rock and searching everywhere for a solution. There were none.





As a responsible & private person who could never imagine herself in this position, Karen is outgoing and extroverted but private about her personal business. She is shy to let people know about what she is going through. She felt she would be able to manage her MS and her expenses for the rest of her life.

We've been friends for 25+ years. Karen helped me out when I was in a difficult situation and I know she helps many others, having spent the better part of the last few years caring for her Mom, whom she recently lost, and then her father following the death.

Karen is a faithful, caring, giving person and I want to ensure she stays healthy and stays on the medication so vital for her life.

Thank you for helping her maintain her health. And for letting me help my friend.

Some questions you might have... 



MS is currently classified as an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (brain, spinal cord). The disease attacks myelin, the protective covering of the nerves, causing inflammation and often damaging the myelin. Myelin is necessary for the transmission of nerve impulses through nerve fibres. If damage to myelin is slight, nerve impulses travel with minor interruptions; however, if damage is substantial and if scar tissue replaces the myelin, nerve impulses may be completely disrupted, and the nerve fibres themselves can be damaged.

MS is unpredictable and can cause symptoms such as extreme fatigue, lack of coordination, weakness, tingling, impaired sensation, vision problems, bladder problems, cognitive impairment and mood changes. Its effects can be physical, emotional and financial.

Source: 



Her disease usually affects the left side of her body. She has continuous neuropathic pain in her left side (meaning the pain is not the result of injury but of a broken 'connection' in her brain that tells her leg to ache constantly). She has weakness and tingling in her extremities and has experienced debilitating fatigue, muscle spasms, memory problems, vision loss and cognitive issues.

Medication and Supplies,"$1,575 raised of $1,000 goal","Hello, family & friends, why I'm raising funds. On November 8th, 2023 in the morning. I ended up at Providence St. John's Emergency Room with extreme abdominal pain. I was admitted and later that evening taken into an 8 hour surgery. My surgeon told my husband it was the worst abcesse she had seen in years. I had a perforated colon and a colostomy was put in place. I had to have a blood transfusion and i am still on daily IV antibiotics. I have been back to the ER 3 more times. The last on ER visir was 11/17/2023, my home health PT nurse, noticed my heart rate was high and both feet and legs are swollen. She suggested I go back to the ER, to rule out a blood clot. I followed orders and I do have a right clot that can be repaired with medication. I was discharged with a prescription of Eliquis. Unfortunately, my insurance does not cover this medication. This is so foreign for me to ask for help, but here i am asking. I need help. Most of you know I have not worked since the pandemic. I take care of parent's and in-laws. I am hoping that by the end of January 2024 God willing I'll be about 60% of myself again. I know this is so close to the holidays, anything will be of assistance.

Medical bills and medication,$785 raised,"Hi, my name is Wanda Sutton. In 2021 I was diagnosed with stage 1 metastatic breast cancer. I’ve been thru chemotherapy and had several surgeries. My last surgery was 6 months ago and has left me with debilitating pain. I am unable to do things like walk my dog, go to the grocery store, and drive. The medicine that I take to keep the cancer from coming back is $300 per month. I don’t have the money to pay for my medication so I’m cutting my pills in half which is not recommended. I’ve reached out to several assistance programs but I was denied because I’m working. I’ve also looked at discount prescription programs and the prices are over $400! My doctor has prescribed me other pills for my breast cancer but the side effects were too hard on my body. This has caused me to be very stressed out. I know that with inflation people don’t have much to give, but a small donation can help save my life.","Raleigh, NC"

"Emilys cancer journey: fund treatment, save lives","£81,516 raised of £90,000 goal","Hi, my name is Emily. This is my story and how you can help: 

Last November (2022) our whole world was turned upside down when Emily received a shock diagnosis of stage 4 bowel cancer, spread to her liver (colorectal liver metastasis). After a 12 hour wait in A&E and discovery of ""a mass"" on her liver, this devastating news came as a complete shock. Emily had always been in good health and - so she thought - she had been under the care of healthcare professionals since symptoms began in 2019.

Tragically, the iron anaemia - which medics had been aware of for over 2 years - was never properly investigated, until Emily finally asked “but WHY am I iron anaemic?” and a locum GP broke ‘practice rules’ (despite NICE guidelines advising testing with her symptoms). They issued a FIT test, with off the scale results*. Severe abdominal pains - on Mothering Sunday, 9 months before diagnosis - were dismissed by A&E as ""probably muscular"" and a diagnosis of iron anaemia given. [* a Faecal Immunochemical Test looks for blood in a sample of your poo and can show abnormal bleeding].

Help Emma get the treatment she urgently needs,"£61,648 raised","Just over a year ago, our daughter Emma was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma, a cancer of the soft tissues. She started treatment immediately and her life, and ours, were turned upside down.

Emma went bravely through 9 rounds of chemotherapy, 28 sessions of radiotherapy (all under general anaesthetics) and responded really well to that first phase of treatment. Despite becoming extremely weak at times, she always managed to win the hearts of people around her with her unlimited affection and fun personality.

She started getting better over the summer, but sadly a new tumour was found in her throat in October, indicating an early relapse. Options for treatments are now far more limited. In addition to 12 new rounds of chemotherapy, her medical team believe that the best chance of controlling the disease is for her to undergo a treatment called AMORE, which, due to the location of her tumour, can only be carried out at the Princess Maxima Center in the Netherlands. The procedure involves a major surgery to remove the tumour, followed by the insertion of rods in the neck in order to deliver brachytherapy radiation.

For those who know Thor, he’s a happy kid, smiling and constantly laughing. Some may have noticed developmental delays and other aspects of his personality that make him a little different to most boys his age.

First two years of Thorben’s life were similar to a healthy happy toddler. He had good development progress and gave us no indication of underlining health issues.

At the age of 2, we began noticing behavioural changes, development delays and a change in his personality. As parents, it was an emotional rollercoaster. We went through days of worry, not to mention the tears and the struggles to find the answers to our son's condition. After multiple visits to our paediatrician, tests and referrals to other specialised doctors, Thorben was diagnosed with Autism. This confirmed the signs of developmental delays, sensory processing disorders, motor skills impairment, non-verbal behaviours, chronic gastrointestinal issues and brain inflammation from his daily seizures.

Help with Jake's Treatment,"$93,586 raised of $125,000 goal","Jenne Mocko is a teacher in the Morris School District. Her 17-year-old son, Jake, has been diagnosed with Grade IV astrocytoma, a rare, central nervous system cancer.  Jenne is a Preschool Intervention and Referral Team member and has dedicated her career to helping children with special needs and now she needs your help. 

Jake is currently undergoing radiation therapy, something this type of cancer usually does not respond well to. When radiation is complete, it is recommended he participate in clinical trials in Washington. The situation is ever-changing and we want to help in any way to alleviate any stress and any out-of-pocket expenses that will ultimately come of this. This situation is urgent and I am asking you all to spread the word and help in any way you can.

A few months ago, Jake, started feeling pain in his lower back. Over-the-counter pain meds and physical therapy did not relieve him of the constant pain. They were told they call a neurologist, who after hearing of his symptoms, immediately recommended he get an MRI. To their shock, a very large tumor was discovered in his spine. They were told it was benign, but surgery for removal was scheduled right away. They removed most of the mass, but pieces wrapped around his spinal cord were unreachable. Jake was left with no mobility in his legs and arms and was left with a loss of feeling in his mid-section.

While they focused on helping him learn to walk and move his arms again, they were blindsided with the diagnosis of an aggressive and rare form of cancer. The family is devastated. Jake is a sweet, humble, and loving child who does not deserve to suffer through this. To aggravate matters, the rehabilitation center he is currently staying in has recommended he move back home on 8/17. He is wheelchair-bound and the home is not set up for his care. A wheelchair ramp must be installed, his bed must be moved into the dining room on the first floor, the first-floor bathroom will need to be configured to somehow fit a wheelchair, and the list is growing. Please help!

Treatment For Jack,"£23,850 raised of £20,000 goal","Our Youngest Son, Jack, has just been diagnosed with Retinitis Pigmentosa. This inherited eye condition affects one in 4000 people in the UK.
Retinitis Pigmentosa can cause a gradual decline of sight or can also be aggressive, which has now been diagnosed in our son within the past six weeks.
THERE IS NO CURE
We have traced a clinic in Berlin, Germany, that specialises in this disease. Jack will receive 10 x treatments over the space of two weeks, and if the treatments are a success, Jack will regain anything from two times-three times his vision and possibly regain his night vision.
These procedures would hopefully mean that Jack would recover most of his vision and, hopefully, lead as normal a life as possible without going blind.

Back in Feb 22 Katie, at the age of 36 was diagnosed with cervical cancer, after waiting 3 months for treatment the cancer had inevitably spread to lymph nodes.

She got through it and was back playing rugby in no time, and had an amazing summer with her Boys and Tom.

Treatment for Ted,"£74,080 raised of £150,000 goal","If you know us personally then you will already know by now that our baby boy, Ted, has cancer. He has a cancer about as rare as they come, in a place about as rare as they come and incredibly difficult to treat. It’s in his sinus and has spread to his skull base. Because the type of cancer Ted has is unknown, this means that there are no proven treatments or prognosis for him. It also means that radiotherapy may not be successful as there is no evidence that the tumour would respond (some cancers aren’t radio-sensitive) and there is a huge amount of risk to the surrounding healthy tissues like his eye & brain. There is also a risk that once radiotherapy has been done, surgery afterwards wouldn’t be possible

Despite the tumour reacting brilliantly to chemotherapy and shrinking significantly, chemo alone will not keep the cancer at bay for much longer. The team treating Ted in Nottingham have referred his case to both Birmingham Children’s & Great Ormond Street Hospital’s but the consensus in the UK is that surgery will not be possible, which means that we have no choice but to look elsewhere for treatment. Our oncologist has referred Ted to a hospital in the Netherlands that has a pioneering programme to treat head and neck cancers in children but funding has been refused by the NHS. We’re also in discussion with a children’s hospital in the US that specialises in minimally invasive surgery of the skull base in children.

Help Jaclyn Get a Lifesaving Medical Treatment,"$12,589 raised of $60,000 goal","Hi, my name is Jayme and I am reaching out to friends, family, the community, and anyone who can find the kindness in their heart to help my best friend, Jaclyn Hendricks, get the life-changing and lifesaving medical treatment she desperately needs.

Back in September 2017, Jaclyn suffered a foot injury while attending a rock festival in Janesville, WI. From that injury, over the next year, stemmed a rare condition called CRPS (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome) -- otherwise known as the SUICIDE DISEASE. It is the most painful and debilitating condition known to man. Unfortunately, over the next year (2018), and the 25 months that followed, Jaclyn went undiagnosed as she went from doctor to doctor to specialist after specialist and no one could figure out what was wrong with her. She was initially misdiagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis and that medication was a nightmare in itself -- all the while her CRPS was progressing. Jaclyn eventually lost her ability to walk or stand for any amount of time, which lead to her losing her job as a pediatric CMA of 10 years, and becoming permanently disabled. Her pain was so severe her feet felt as though they were on literalall the time. Level 10/10 pain. Even the air hitting her skin was incredibly painful to endure, much less being able to wear shoes or even socks. It wasn't until November 2020 that Jaclyn went to a new podiatrist in her continued search for answers and they instantly knew what was happening. At that moment, it was the biggest sigh of relief. They knew what was wrong and how to fix her! Hopes were high and there were big expectations with the potential treatment that came next. In April 2021, Jaclyn underwent surgery to install a Spinal Cord Stimulator into her spine, in an effort to scramble the signals her brain sends to the nerves in her feet. The procedure was a success, but sadly it wasn't the fix her and doctors were hoping for. The stimulator does help lessen the pain, but not anywhere near enough for Jaclyn to live a normal life, as prolonged use of her limbs (it has now started to spread into both arms), weather changes, or any attempt of leaving the house to go anywhere, only results in days in bed with pain so severe even the stimulator barely helps. And there's nothing else her doctors can do for her. At this point, they have exhausted all options.

Justin’s overseas cancer treatment fund,"£81,385 raised of £200,000 goal","Hi everyone, I’m fundraising for my partner Justin and would be so grateful for any donations however big or small to support us in getting Justin the treatment he needs.
Justin was diagnosed with 2 cancers last year, one being an extremely rare and aggressive form of blood cancer called Primary Cutaneous Diffuse B Cell Lymphoma of the leg type on top of a previous diagnosis of Large B-Cell lymphoma , this cancer grows daily and in the skin , within weeks of no treatment Justin’s leg swells up and large blisters and tumours grow on top of his leg , he has multiple wounds and limited mobility, he’s been battling this for over a year, how he has carried on with the pain and discomfort is admirable. Justin has undergone 14 rounds of chemotherapy, 15 rounds of radiotherapy as well as his most recent treatment CAR-T therapy in less than 12 months , but his cancer is so aggressive that the treatment hasn’t worked. We are currently looking at treatment worldwide as there seems to be more options for his rare form of cancer overseas than is currently offered in the UK. We have exhausted all options on the NHS and they will no longer support Justin with any further treatment other than palliative/end of life care.
We are currently looking at potential trials for Justin to undertake in the UK but in the interim we can’t sit back and not look at alternative treatments elsewhere. If Justin needs to get get treatment overseas then we will need to act on this quickly as his cancer is very aggressive and time is not on our side. I don’t feel comfortable doing this however I would do anything in my power to help save Justin and for us to continue living as a family. We have a 3 year old son Joey who are both each others worlds. They are the very best of friends and I can’t think of them being without each-other. Your donations towards helping with our fundraising for alternative treatments for Justin is so appreciated. We would be so grateful for any donations however big or small to help contribute towards us finding the right treatment for Justin. If this money is not needed then any donations given will be donated to Blood Cancer UK and Cancer Research UK for further steps towards making a difference to other families as I would not want anyone else to endure what we have had to over the past year.

Jason Bowen’s Motor Neurone Disease Treatment,"£23,263 raised of £25,000 goal","Jason Bowen is a 50 year old ex professional footballer from Merthyr, now living in Langstone, Newport. He’s the son of Terry and Louise, brother of Ricky, husband to Hayley, father to Jaye, Sam and Theo and Daddo to Carter.

In March 2021 he was given the devastating Motor Neurone Disease diagnosis after feeling weakness and twitching in his arm. Sadly, Hayley’s mum passed away from this cruel disease 15 years ago.

Motor Neurone Disease is a Neuro Degenerative Disease (NDD) which essentially means Jason’s central nervous system is unable to send signals to his motor neurones, which are critical to be able to move limbs and control movement. There is no cure for MND.

"Help raise £200,000 to fund treatment for Ethan","£247,788 raised of £200,000 goal","In August 2022, our eldest son Ethan, aged 14, was unexpectedly diagnosed with a very aggressive type of advanced cancer usually only found in adults.

When anyone is diagnosed with cancer it is heart-breaking for all those around but when it is your child there are no words to describe the pain and helplessness when given the diagnosis.

Our world has been torn apart, with complete disbelief that this was happening to what was an ultra-fit, healthy and strong teenager who was a talented athlete, footballer, and all-round fun-loving sportsman. Ethan played football for Cwrt Rawlin Football Club, Risca Academy and for his school St Martins Comprehensive, Caerphilly. Ethan is a huge Wales football fan and prior to his illness attended every home game over the last 9 years. He ran long-distance and cross country for Cardiff Archers, Cardiff Athletics Club and South Wales, competing nationally. Even as recently as May 2022, Ethan won the Caerphilly 2k run and in June finished 4th in the Welsh 800m Championships. All of this has now been cruelly taken from him due to this terrible disease.

Many of Justin's friends have reached out and said they want to help Justin now rather than buy flowers at his funeral, and this funding vehicle gives them the power to do so.

Justin has always been a fit and healthy person, and this came as a great shock as he had not shown any symptoms. It was only when suffering with acute back pain that an MRI scan diagnosed his condition.

Please help me get cancer treatment in Spain,"£40,470 raised","Hi, my name is Jenny. I'm a 47 year old teacher and I live near Bath with my husband and 2 teenage children.
In 2018 I was diagnosed with a very rare cancer called Pseudomyxoma Peritonei. This is a complex cancer which originates in the appendix and spreads throughout the abdomen.
I have had 2 major surgeries at Basingstoke hospital and I have had a combined total of 18 months of chemotherapy at my local hospital in Bath. Despite this, I still have cancer and I have reached the point where there are no more treatment options available in the UK. I have contacted every specialist hospital and referred myself for every possible clinical trial, with no success.
Through a Facebook support group, I found out about a treatment called PIPAC which is used successfully to treat my cancer in several countries around the world. Unfortunately it's not available in the UK. It's essentially a keyhole surgery where pressurised aerosol chemotherapy is sprayed directly into my abdomen. I have been in contact with Dr Cortes Guiral at the Santa Elena Hospital in Madrid, Spain, who has reviewed my case. She has said that I would need at least 3 PIPAC treatments, 4 weeks apart. I may also need some other procedures to make the PIPAC more effective (such as Bromac injections directly into any tumours that are deeply embedded-this is also not available in the UK).

In March this year, I was living a normal life, working, going out and very healthy. However, because of a steroid-induced eczema flare-up in April this year, I was prescribed steroids which have resulted in my developing a chronic condition called Topical Steroid Withdrawal. This has turned my entire life upside down. Biologically speaking – this is an extreme and adverse effect of stopping steroid use.

As you can see from the pictures, from head to toe I am covered in painful, dry, and flaking skin which has impacted every aspect of my life and I have been living in agony. The itchiness is unlike anything I’ve ever experienced, it’s bone-deep and relentless to say the least. I’m currently unable to eat gluten or dairy and go out in the sunlight. Routine activities such as showering and sleeping are painful and it’s impacting my ability to live a normal life.

Eleanor’s Cancer Treatment Fund,"$52,825 raised of $75,000 goal","On May 8, 2023 my 12 year old niece, Eleanor Guimarin (Who we affectionately call E), was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic b cell lymphoblastic Lymphoma. This fund is being set up for her and her parents, Kim and Steve, to help cover chemotherapy treatments and other medical expenses.

On April 28, 2023, after two months of on and off back pain, originally diagnosed as a pulled muscle, Eleanor was sent to the ER. An MRI revealed a parent’s worst nightmare, sizable masses on her lungs and on her spine, causing fractures in her spine. This led to Eleanor getting immediately checked into the neuropediatric ICU. After multiple days there and unable to perform a biopsy due to low sodium levels, doctors determined it was an invasive cancer and decided they needed to start Eleanor on a broad chemotherapy treatment. A biopsy was finally able to take place days later, giving us her diagnosis.

“I was 22 when I was diagnosed with a high-grade brain tumour. It was the summer I finished university and scans revealed a golf-ball-sized growth in my right temporal lobe after I collapsed in the street one afternoon. My life was put on hold and I underwent a lengthy period of treatment. I had surgery to remove as much of the tumour as possible, followed by an intense course of high-dose radiotherapy and a further 12 months of chemotherapy in an attempt to control the tumour and hold back regrowth.

My skin itches for hours after I come into contact with any type of water including rain, sweat, tears, urine etc. The condition is called Aquagenic Pruritus, which I am suffering from an extremely severe case of. My symptoms began at around age 5 and steadily worsened as I went through puberty. At 5 years old, I started to have allergic reactions to my showers, which doctors believed was due to changes in my hormones during puberty. After many attempted treatments to lessen my symptoms, they soon decided that my skin condition was likely incurable. I had undergone over 8 years of treatment, having exhausted every available treatment avenue available on the NHS. My condition responded to nothing they had tried and they couldn’t find a specific cause for why this could be happening to me.

Rachel's Treatment,"£166,261 raised","https://www.instagram.com/tv/CFIJ67sncC4/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link 
Rachel is the youngest member of our family. At 18 years old, she had just finished her final year of school and was excited at the prospect of leaving home and studying Anatomy at the University of Glasgow later this month. However, Rachel's and our world was turned upside down in July. After suffering reduced power in her right leg and subsequent foot drop during lockdown, Rachel had an MRI scan presenting a tumour in her spinal cord mid July. She had emergency surgery on the 24th of July and we were then given the most devastating news that Rachel was diagnosed with a diffuse midline glioma (a very rare and aggressive tumour residing inside her spinal cord) for which there is currently no cure. Victims of this tumour have a very short life expectancy from diagnosis and therefore we are looking at every option available to potentially prolong Rachel's life as much as possible. While Rachel is currently undertaking 6 weeks of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, this route of treatment can only be taken once, so therefore we are looking at further emerging treatment options. We need to raise funds to allow Rachel to take part in a clinical trial in America using a new drug which is unfortunately not available on the NHS. This drug has shown promising signs from previous data and therefore has given us a glimmer of hope that Rachel could potentially fulfil her dream of going to university. We are so proud of Rachel-she is vivacious and fun-loving and she always thinks of everyone else but now is the time where we are asking family and friends to help Rachel. We want to do everything in our power to help her, so any donations to support her treatment in America would be hugely appreciated and we can't thank you all enough for the support. Lots of love from the Osborne Family.

Cancer treatment for my sister,"£38,154 raised of £100,000 goal","My darling sister Claire has been given the devastating diagnosis of incurable brain cancer. Under the current NHS treatment we have been told people with her diagnosis can expect to live 2 years on average.

She has been amazingly strong and brave throughout, since her diagnosis in early January, but the hardest part for her is she has 9 year son who is the light of her life, and it's heartbreaking that she won't be there to see him grow up.

Because of her love for her son, Claire is determined to fight this as hard as she can, to try and live as long as she possibly can and even beat the odds and live longer than the doctors predict. She's changing her diet drastically, is meditating to get her body in a healing state and even doing things like laughter yoga to help boost her immune system. But this isn't enough for her. With cancers like hers, there are new promising treatments currently emerging that can be used in conjunction with conventional chemo/radiotherapy and if successful they can help to extend life expectancy.

I’m living in Classis Lake, Ballincollig for over 20 years but Paddy is one of the few neighbours I chat with regularly. It could be just a wave across the courtyard, but he always goes out of his way to chat and check in on all his neighbours. He is of a generation where community was a lifeline and I wish there were more of that. I see this in many estates now, where a sense of community is lost and people that have lived side by side for years barely speak. But Paddy was about to change that by introducing me to my neighbours, the Molnar family.

Paddy introduced me to Renata and Balazs. We’ve been neighbours for 17 years and we probably passed each other by, but not anymore. I learned of the difficult situation they find themselves in. Renata and Balazs, have three beautiful daughters. Hanna, 11, Bella, 8 and the baby, Emma, who will celebrate her 6th birthday this month.

Let's End Preeclampsia- Without Drugs!,"$10,845 raised of $100,000 goal","My goal is to fund a clinical trial using a specific mixture of dietary fats to treat preeclampsia.

Although preeclampsia of pregnancy has been recognized as a human disease for over 2000 years, physicians and researches still do not know its cause. Many of us have been personally touched by this deadly disease as it affects 5-8% of births in the United States and and is responsible for 15% of maternal deaths worldwide. A 2013 episode of Downton Abbey in which Lady Sybil Branson died raised public interest in preeclampsia. Ten years later, the shocking news of Olympic gold medalist Tori Bowie’s death from eclampsia brought the sober realization that this disease is still an uncontrolled killer. Presently, the only cure for preeclampsia is to end the pregnancy, sometimes so prematurely that the baby dies or suffers lifelong disability.

The tournament will be held on April 29, 2017 at Gloria J Parks Community Center from 10am-3pm. We are asking you all to donate again & dig even deeper for this worthy cause. I'd like to maybe even triple last years donations. All proceeds to benefit Kids Escaping Drugs Campaign. There will be food, 50-50, face-painting & well....the games. Entry fee is $5. If you can, please come out to support me & The Kids Escaping Drugs Campaign that would be great!! And if you can't make it, are out of town, or just donate here,right now!","Buffalo, NY"
"Salama: Keep Youth in Eldoret, Kenya off Drugs","$2,550 raised of $20,500 goal","Hi, I am organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Kiragu Benson and the Tumaini Innovation Center. We are currently fundraising for the first $4,000 of a $100,000 campaign.  
-----------
SALAMA means “safe” in Swahili. The Salama Home Initiative (SHI) seeks to establish housing and programming to safely transition young people from rehabilitation and charitable centers to an independent, healthy, and successful life away from their former destructive behaviors.

Eldoret, Kenya with close to half a million residents, lacks established programs and resources to continue supporting individuals who have completed rehabilitation for drugs and substance abuse or youth exiting from children’s charitable institutions. 60% of youth rarely have employment and a supportive network to coach and nurture their personal, professional, and financial growth. Individuals find it challenging, if not impossible to remain sober and rebuild their new life. Consequently, due to the lack of support from their peers, ostracization by their family, lack of job opportunities, and financial pressures, they are persuaded back into the company of their former street life and drug abuse. Kiragu Benson knows this story well as it was also his story. Your funds today will help Kiragu share his life story with Eldoret youth to support their will to turn their life around and offer encouragement and resources to strengthen their capacity to lead stable and successful lives. 

Together, alongside Tumaini Innovation Center, Kiragu Benson and his staff will be launching weekly programming and mentorship initiatives in September 2022 in Eldoret, Kenya for a cohort of individuals graduating from Tumaini Innovation Center. Programming will focus on financial stability, conflict management, and mental wellness. In 2023, Kiragu seeks to secure multifamily property to support the development of transitional rental housing to complement SHI’s supportive programming. The United States Embassy publicly recognized the Salama Home Initiative in Nairobi, in March 2022.

Helping Emily get life saving drugs,"£22,139 raised of £159,526 goal","Emily has Cystic Fibrosis (CF). CF is a genetic condition where sufferers experience a build-up of thick sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the entire body.  For Emily this has also meant she has CF related diabetes.

Despite the fact that there is currently no cure for CF, there are treatments that can improve patients quality of life.  Emily has to independently incorporate over three hours of treatments into her every day life. This includes, physio, giving IV antibiotics, blood monitoring and taking over 30 tablets a day. 
Emily started university last year and manages to get through each day like every other sufferer but recently she has found the illness very difficult to cope with. In the past year, despite all treatments and long periods in hospital, her health has deteriorated greatly and her lung function and weight  has dropped significantly. 

Currently, Emily has a rare fungus called Scedosporium which causes thick muscus in her lungs. This has now caused permanent damage to her lungs, resulting in further decline in lung function and weight loss. 

Symdeko is a prescription drug used for the treatment of CF, currently not available on the NHS. This drug slows the decline in lung function - the main cause of death among people with CF. 
The Cystic Fibrosis Trust are currently campaigning to put pressure on the Government, NHS and pharmaceutical companies to ensure these drugs reach the people who need them without delay. 
However this has been a long campaign which is still ongoing and unfortunately  may not be in time for Emily to benefit.

I have had a quote from Vertex (pharmaceutical company) for a years supply of Symdeko which could buy Emily some time. Unfortunately, this comes with a price tag of £159,526.92!!! 

Therefore, I'm reaching out to you all in the hope that we can reach this target together. Any contribution large or small would be gratefully received. 


Thank you x

Take Medicine Back from Corporate Practice,"$37,880 raised of $200,000 goal","In order to save American medicine, control healthcare costs, and protect the public, it is time to resurrect the ban on corporate interference in the physician-patient relationship. Prohibitions on the corporate practice of medicine (CPOM) emerged during the Gilded Age when physicians raised an alarm to the dangers posed to their profession and patients by powerful corporations of the time. The antitrust movement recognized similar threats to the public and took on monopoly power during the great trust busting era.

More than a century later, following an era of lax antitrust enforcement, prohibitions on CPOM have been eroded and are broadly unenforced. More physicians (74 percent) are now employees of corporations—hospitals, insurance companies, private equity firms, and retail—than in history. Recognition of our entrance into a second Gilded Age has ushered in a new movement in antitrust enforcement. Just as antitrust enforcement has experienced a rise, fall, and rebirth, so too must there be a rebirth of prohibitions on the corporate practice of medicine.

Support for Tami’s Anti-Rejection Drugs,"$3,010 CAD raised of $3,000 goal","On November 3, 2009, Tami Nicolas underwent a kidney transplant surgery in London, Ontario which saved her life.
Due to unfortunate circumstances that Tami is undergoing, she no longer has access to drug benefits. The loss of these benefits will effect her ability to support the costs of the anti-rejection drug that supports her low immune system. Without these drugs, Tami will likely face kidney failure again resulting in undergoing dialysis for the rest of her life.

The minimum costs of these drugs are $11,000 / year.

Help SKPP keep our youth off of drugs & alcohol,"$4,230 raised of $5,000 goal","In May of this year I will be running the 78 mile long North-South trail that extends from southern Massachusetts to southern Rhode Island. I am FIRED up for this opportunity to push myself, accomplish something great, and use this effort to impact my community.

This will be completely self-supported and I have a goal of completing it within 30 hours. I will coordinate opportunities for the brave and supportive souls that want to meet up to run a solid chunk of miles with me. Here is more info on the trail:

https://thetrek.co/rhode-island-north-south-trail-78-miles-atlantic-ocean-massachusetts/

I am excited to begin the newest mission to impact our local South Kingstown Rhode Island community. This fundraising effort will benefit South Kingstown Partnership for Prevention (SKPP)

SKPP is all about the health and safety of the South Kingstown youth. SKPP focuses on the biggest risk our kids — and every other teen in the country — face: the many opportunities they have today to experiment with alcohol and other drugs.

SKPP is working hard to create community-based prevention initiatives that are the surest route to alcohol and drug-free kids. They are also the most economical route. One dollar spent on prevention saves $18 in the costs related to underage substance use.

Most of us are very aware of the heart wrenching effects of drug and alcohol addiction. We MUST all do our part to help prevent more lives from being broken or lost.

Please consider donating to this life saving cause. SKPP works directly with the youth of our community and we want to help them strengthen their support with additional funding.

ANY amount you can afford is EXTREMELY appreciated.

Thank you for your unwavering support! 

Love you guys

***All proceeds will be presented to SKPP in the form of a check at the end of the fundraising campaign. SKPP is not registered as a 503c(3) so they cannot take ONLINE donations directly.  Here is a link with more information on SKPP:

"Drug Incinerator Needed for Lufkin, TX","$2,160 raised of $5,650 goal","Hi, my name is Taha Nazeer and I am a Life Scout from Troop 140 in Lufkin, TX. I am raising money for my Eagle Scout project, which is to install a prescription drug incinerator at the Angelina County Sheriff's Office.
There are many people, especially teens, in Angelina County who overdose on prescription drugs. To help address this problem, there’s currently a medication drop box at the Sheriff's Office where people can properly dispose of their unwanted or expired prescription drugs. 
Once the drop box is filled up, those drugs must be taken to Houston to be incinerated. Currently, it can cost upwards of $2,250 each year to travel to Houston, so if the Sheriff’s Office gets an incinerator, it would greatly reduce costs for the county. This would not only aid Lufkin, but also other towns like Hudson, Huntington, and Zavalla.

Also, all donors will be acknowledged on a plaque at the Sheriff's Office based on the amount of money donated:

General Sponsor: Donates $1-$249
Silver Sponsor: $250-$499
Gold Sponsor: $500-$999
Platinum Sponsor: $1,000 or more

Trey Love’s Functional Medicine Journey,"$7,961 raised of $10,000 goal","Hi all! I’m sure most of you have heard of the amazing Trey Love. Trey is a remarkable 16 year old boy who has experienced more in life than most could imagine. He is a two time cancer survivor, a stroke survivor and is currently struggling with intractable epilepsy. Intractable epilepsy is epilepsy that is resistant to drugs or uncontrolled by drugs. Trey’s life since the seizures have started has been a whirlwind of medication changes, brain surgeries, and more medications. The amount of medications he was on have severely affected Trey’s quality of life leaving him in a zombie like state in a regular basis. It is our goal to increase Trey’s quality of life to the best of our ability and that includes some out of the box options such as a functional neurologist. This functional neurologist has hope that he will be able to improve Trey’s quality of life as a whole and decrease the seizures that Trey is experiencing regularly. This doctor would like Trey to come up to NYC to see him for one full week on intensive treatments and once a month at least. Unfortunately insurance does not cover the cost of these treatments. So we are asking for your help to support the Love’s in their journey for whole body health as they take yet another leap of faith for Trey. Trey may have survived the unthinkable twice but his story doesn’t end there. Prayers for much needed improvement for Treys quality of life are always welcome.

Lucy's legal drugs fund,"£101,435 raised of £156,000 goal","I'm Lucy, a 40 year old mum of 2 beautiful daughters (7 & 2). In May 2019 I received the devastating diagnosis of Stage 4 bowel cancer that had spread extensively throughout my liver. I also have a very rare mutation that makes my cancer very aggressive.  At the time I was given a best case scenario prognosis of 20 months, which will take me to this December. But I am desperate to beat this for the sake of my girls and my wonderful husband Iain.

For a while I had some success with treatments available through the NHS and my private healthcare. I enrolled on a trial in July 19 and the triplet of drugs I was given reduced the cancer greatly. Unfortunately it stopped working after 3 months.  I then switched to chemo, and had another good response.

At the beginning of this year we were feeling hopeful and I took a chemo break to see if surgery might be an option.  Sadly the tumours in my liver started growing back.  I was offered a radiotherapy treatment called SIRT, but this failed and I had even more growth in my liver.

In May I went back on chemo, but this stopped working at the end of July.  I have now gone back on the targeted therapy I was on last summer, but we don't expect this to work for more than a couple of months if at all. I'm basically running out of options.

I had some molecular testing done, and it showed that my cancer is highly mutated. This leads my oncologist to believe that immunotherapy might work for me, but unfortunately it is not approved in Europe for my type of cancer. When immunotherapy works it can be a game changer, and unlike chemo, could potentially be curative. 

For the sake of my daughters, I have to try everything I can to have more time with them, but the cost of the immunotherapy drug that I will have to self fund is an eye-watering £6k every 2 weeks!

I would be so grateful for any help that you can give me.  If it works I could be taking this drug for years.  If it doesn't I will invest the money in any other medical options, or if the worst was to happen we will donate the money to bowel cancer UK to try and make sure other young mums' don't have to go through this.

Thank you for any support you can offer.

Lots of Love

Anti-Drug/Alcohol Teen Rescue,"$4,080 raised of $35,000 goal","Relentless Rescue is a non-profit organization with one simple message - You are loved.

Our goal around that message is to build a facility from a renovated firehouse that provides a safe place for young men and women to gather and get educated on the dangers of drug and alcohol addiction, in addition to gang prevention and intervention. A place where mentors are there to help navigate teens towards a positive future. A place with information and resources for desperate parents and teens to get answers. We will have scheduled drug, alcohol, and gang education classes, along with parenting classes for families with at risk children. Relentless Rescue will provide academics, arts, and athletics for young people to find a passion far away from negative influences. We want teens to walk through our doors knowing they will be welcomed without judgement into a place where they will always find encouragement and understanding.

My name is Juaquin Fabela, president of Relentless Rescue. I am a former gang member and alcoholic who was on a path to nowhere. Seventeen years ago I made a life changing decision to stop the negativity and begin a life serving God through the mentorship I found at an outreach sports center. Since then I have had the honor and opportunity of speaking to over 1 million young people throughout the United States on the consequences of bad decisions. I have received numerous awards for my advocacy dealing with teens and young adults, and now I am ready to build a facility that in turn, will do what was done for me. Through my experiences I've found that it is a whole lot easier to prevent young men and women from becoming addicts and/or gang members, than it is to try and fix the problem once it's already begun. Help us fight for the future of our children...the victory is WORTH the fight!

Relentless Rescue will be a place with a fully functioning stage to be used for various performing arts inclusive of- spoken word, musical performances, stage presentations, and theatrics, etc. This space houses an upstairs area that can provide a social setting for group activities or even a quiet place for studying and homework. There will also be an onsite snack and coffee bar with Wifi access throughout the center. The outside area will feature a weight facility, volleyball court, BBQ, and firepit. This will be a cutting edge and safe place for families and friends to spend their time.

Relentless Rescue is a proud supporter and partner of organizations such as New Hope Street Ministry who go out faithfully every Saturday rain or shine to feed the homeless, as well as Unseen Youth who travel to Cambodia to fight sex trafficking.

We need your support to make all of these life saving dreams become a reality. We are asking for your support and donations so that we can begin this AMAZING journey.

Peptide drugs to treat ALS,"$3,180 raised of $50,000 goal","Money is needed to develop drugs to treat ALS and a number of neurological diseases. 

The funds are required to purchase proteases (enzymes) and their specific enzyme inhibitors as models for drug design.

It is important to purchase these materials as soon as possible. In our novel approach, the enzyme and its specific inhibitor are crystallized together to form co-crystals. X-Ray crystallographers will analyze the co-crystals to determine the specific sequence of amino acids in the active site of the inhibitor (reactive central loop or RCL) that binds to amino acids in the active site of the enzyme. The identified amino acid sequence in the RCL (of the inhibitor) is synthesized and used as a drug or pseudo inhibitor to compensate for the natural complement enzyme inhibitor that is damaged or significantly below physiological concentrations. Enzymes in the complement system that are not regulated by specific inhibitors mediates damage to motor neuron in individuals with neurological disorders and other diseases.

Saleyha Ahsan, a Medical Doctor, involved in both the Syrian and Ukraine convoys added, “The People’s Convoy for Syria delivered £250,000 worth of medical equipment to a children’s hospital in Aleppo in 2016 with public support. I’m hoping we can match that for Ukraine and achieve our objective in sending over multiple convoys throughout the conflict, which will each time supply medical equipment that is most in demand.”

Music is Essential Medicine,"$4,044 CAD raised of $13,731 goal","Dear lovers of music and magical thinking... through events in a story too long to tell right now, I'm in Istanbul.  Here, the same as everywhere now, the situation is quite precarious in every sense.  in this strange, savage time, music & art are so incredibly important for our spirits.  in this madness though, I still see light, synchronicity & soulful possibilities.  there are master musicians here in Istanbul (as everywhere of course) who have had no work for several months now.  I've never thought before to crowdfund but these times require open thinking and I thought it would be good to try.  I would like to make something beautiful of my time in this incredible place to share.  I'm a troubadour....literally a wandering minstrel.  i love collaboration.  I love the fusion of culture & style.  There is an opportunity here to assemble some incredible master musicians to record, as live shows are not possible.  I'd like to make a recording with as many of these musicians as possible, giving them some work and creating  something that brings peace to the listener.  I know things are difficult for all right now but, if you feel it in your heart and can afford, please give to this project.  all I can offer in return is acknowledgement for the contribution written in the liner notes of the booklet and a copy of the disc/download/record itself..... the funds raised will go to studio recording, compensation to the musicians, CD production/promotion expenses and living expenses during the recording period.  

Love and a thousand blessings to all this message reaches.  I leave you with some words from Rumi:

At 2 1/2 years old we woke to the sound of Bailey choking we phoned an ambulance and we were discharged being told it was a Febrile Convulsion. Unfortunately he had another seizure a few weeks later and after a night in hospital we were told he had Epilepsy. From here on Baileys Seizures become more frequent and violent he was having Tonic Clonic Seizures, then they progressed into Drops Seizures, Absent Seizures, Myoclonic Jerks, Partial Seizures which would throughout the day and night.

By Aged 5 and trying numerous medications, Ketogenic Diet, Bailey had an EEG the Results came back with Lennox Gastaut Syndrome an Intractable Form of Epilepsy, Drug Resistant. EEG recorded abnormal brain activity every 2.5 seconds. From this diagnosis Bailey had a Vagal Nerve Stimulator Implant, this stopped the small absent & head Drop Seizures which gave a tiny reprieve. But Bailey still had to go through gruelling Medication regime of having loading doses of drugs every fortnight to try and get some sort of seizure control. But all these drugs came with horrific side effects, Aggression, Frustration, unable to walk, weight loss, Slurred Speech, hair loss, Rashes, oversized Gums, Sleepiness, drooling, hallucinations the list is endless.

Drug copay to start treatment,"$1,550 raised of $1,500 goal","Marty lost his job in October which ended our insurance.   We were able to get new insurance starting November, but that is bringing with it new deductibles to meet. And I cannot get the drugs needed for treatment until this is paid.  The kicker is this will reset and present again January as well.     I had a reoccurrence in September and have been unable to start drug treatment.   I will be doing the Beacon triplet and my insurance will cover it for free once the deductibles are met.  

im asking for assistance from my friends to help me start this treatment.   I am on disability and I am currently down to 94lbs.  I take oral morphine to getthru the pain right now.   The Beacon drugs are a 2 step process which could possibly get me back to remission.  If you all could help me start these drugsI would be very appreciative.  ","Sayre, OK"
FLOURISH,"$5,650 raised of $7,500 goal","In a time before Covid, Intern Retreat was the highlight of our year. Every winter, our interns would go to the Geneva Grand hotel in Lake Geneva for a weekend to reflect, reframe, and reinvigorate. This year, Covid changed everything. Because of Covid, we have had to change so much about our resident's training, funding, and (not least of all) social bonding events.

While we cannot gather or travel this winter, we still want to celebrate our interns in a special way. Thus, FLOURISH was born: February Lifting OUR Interns' Spirits High.  During the month of February, we will plan regular activities to appreciate and support our interns. These events include coffee and bagels, pizzas, treats, notes, raffles, game nights, gifts, and more. 

  We need donations to make this a reality, and to help our interns FLOURISH. Donate now to support this month of gratitude, reflection, and reinvigoration!

Migraine medicine for 16 year old Nathan,$800 raised,"Hi everyone, this fundraiser is for a one month migraine prevention shot called Ajovy which costs $700 out of pocket for my child Nathan.

After denial and appeals process and my son’s neurologist fighting the denial, we are left to cover the cost of this potentially life-changing medication.

Starting in 2021, Nathan was 14 and developed a migraine disorder that erupted into a nearly 7 week intense migraine. After several medications, MRI scans, hospital stays, so much testing, doctors suspect that his migraines could be connected to long Covid (he contracted Covid in late 2020), his hormones, or directly to his congenital heart defect where he was born missing the right side of his heart and has had multiple surgeries to bypass the issue (we call it “replumbing”).

Now 16 years old, Nathan has migraines that are so frequent and painful, that he hasn’t been able to leave his room or his home much and has been isolated with home/hospital schooling. He wants badly to be with his peers again. His quality of life is greatly suffering and he deserves to experience a chance at a more pain-free life. A life like a regular teenager should. Neurology has helped us as far as they can and say that aside from the rescue meds (which are increasingly becoming less helpful), frequent ER visits for IV migraine “cocktail” and due to many medication’s contraindicated for someone with this type of heart condition, Ajovy is our last resort. 

Our family is in desperate need of affording this monthly dose so we can at least see if it helps him. It’s $700 out of pocket and it may very well give him back his life and hopefully return to in-person schooling so he can make friends and thrive. Nathan is super artistic, creative and full of life, and these migraines are suppressing his ability to enjoy life. 
Every penny will go to this medication. Thank you

Katya's Medicine Donation Fund,"$25,038 raised of $40,000 goal","My name is Joel Wasserman. I'm a Rockville, Maryland native who moved to Kyiv in March 2018 to teach English with veterans of the Donbas war. I had built a life in Ukraine’s capital with my partner Katya Sporysh, herself a lifelong Kyivan, before we were forced by Russian aggression to move to Lviv, the country’s main western city.

The first thing Katya did the morning after arriving to safety in the Carpathian mountains after a 26-hour journey fleeing Kyiv, was to go buy medicines for her mother. She thought of all the people in the places under Russian attack who had just lost reliable access to the medications they needed. The war has wreaked havoc upon Ukraine’s medical supply chains and on peoples' access to medications to treat common ailments like hypertension, diabetes, thyroid conditions, and even everyday maladies. Within days of the war starting, Katya had gotten to work using her contacts as a business journalist to start sending medical supplies where they were needed.

LIFESAVING RADIOTHERAPY & MEDICATION FOR JACK,"£4,640 raised of £10,000 goal","Hi, my name is Jack but you can call me Boo as that’s what my family call me. I am just a baby at 5 years old, and my favourite things in the world are walks with my Dad, balls, cheese, and quack quacks (ducks).
My parents, Steve and Leanne have always kept me insured so that I could have treatment if I ever became ill. Turns out that wasn’t going to be enough.

Yesterday we were given the news that I have a very large tumour wrapped around my heart. It’s likely that it has been there for a very long time, but it managed to sneak up on us because I’ve not been poorly or shown any symptoms until recently. We don’t know if it’s cancerous or not because it is too dangerous to take biopsies.

Allan's Drug Rehab Recovery,"$10,620 raised of $36,000 goal","Hello my name is Bassam Sabbagh and I am fundraising to help raise funds for my son Allan Sabbagh. Allan suffered a fentanyl overdose about 10 months ago. Being a father, the worst thing you can do is wake up every day wondering if you’re going to receive a phone call that your son is dead from a drug overdose. It was after this incident that we decided to place Allan in a lockdown rehab facility in Rosarito, Baja California, Mexico. Although in the beginning he was taken there against his will, after spending some time there, he has finally decided that he’s had enough and wants to get better. This drug rehabilitation program is enabling him to address the very difficult challenges that have placed him in this situation. Baja rehab is a very respected program which has the highest success rate for a Drug Free Withdrawal program. They are very reputable and qualified in dealing with individuals that are stuck in the grip of addiction. This is generally a one to two year program and part of the graduating requirements are that he has a job and a place to live and they will continue to support him as he gets set up to do well in life. As you know, the cost of rehab is astronomical and with Allan already being in there for 8 months we have accumulated of a bill of $36,000.

Dustin is losing his vision,"$8,640 raised of $10,000 goal","For those of you who may not know, my brother Dustin is losing his vision due to a condition known as LHON (Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy). Please look it up to learn more about this rare condition. Currently there is no cure for it, but there are several ongoing clinical trials and a few different drugs that have been shown to help. 

Dustin does not have health insurance and will most likely have to stop working soon. Medical bills will start piling up and the drugs are very expensive. He will have to travel to see specialists. 

This is obviously a life changing event for Dustin and will be extremely challenging on many levels. If you know him well, you know that he is always having more fun than anyone. His smile and laugh are infectious. His lust for life is inspiring. He has a huge heart and wants to love everyone around him.

The road ahead will no doubt be very rough and I hope that you can contribute financially. If you cannot, please give him a call or go see him. Encouragement, support and positivity are also valuable and appreciated. 

Thank you very much.

Fight Corporate Practice of Medicine,"$11,206 raised of $1,250,000 goal","We are a private practice that has taken a multi-billion dollar private equity company to court for violation of the Corporate Practice of Medicine doctrine (CPOM). We are coming to you for help to finish the fight.

The Corporate Practice of Medicine doctrine is a legal doctrine, which generally prohibits corporations, entities or non-physicians from practicing medicine. This is important because as a patient, you should expect that the only interest in the exam room when you go to see your doctor, go to surgery or go to the hospital, are your interests. Physicians have sworn to uphold your interests when they graduate from medical school. State medical boards are there to ensure that only physicians of adequate skill and expertise are allowed to take care of patients. Traditionally, if a doctor fails that duty, they will be dealt with by the state board and/or the legal system.

Before long, though, he started waiting for us night and day, and pushed his way into our home.

He coughed a lot, and when we finally felt he trusted us enough we made him a fully inside cat and brought him to the vet. After many, many tests and many, many vet visits (often multiple per month) we were told there was nothing more they could do for him, but despite medications improving his cough they could see his lungs were worsening nonetheless to a mysterious disease or infection that they couldn’t figure out. The vet told us to take him to internal medicine as soon as we could. Unfortunately, our funds have simply run out after so many visits to the vet and other life circumstances.

I have been helping him with money for a couple of years, so his family can get by.

A Medicine Album,"$7,946 raised of $4,444 goal","First of all, thank you. Thank you to whatever magic brought you here. If you're someone I know - Hello, I love you. If we’ve never met - Wow, and welcome.

My name is Andy Fischer-Price, and I’m a musician who currently resides in northwestern Washington on the unceded lands of the Chimakum people. I’m raising funds to help finish my first full-length album of medicine music - songs that are designed to enter the heart space and awaken the divinity within. This is music for healing, praying, journeying, and the integration of mystical experiences.

These are songs that have come through me (mostly through my work with plant medicine) and hold many of my soul’s deepest prayers. I have been sharing a few of them in various medicine/healing circles for years; some are being passed around by friends of mine in circles without me. (Micaela Kingslight has even shared a couple at sacred sites in Mexico, Guatemala, and Turkey!) It’s been beautiful and humbling and strange to witness the reach and impact this music has been able to have without proper recordings and with almost zero hustle on my part. Now I want to help it find its way to the places where it is most needed with proper recordings - a digital sanctuary where people can visit these songs as often as they like.

It is with sadness that I write about the loss of Reece Consul MRPharmS. A loss that will be felt by his family, work colleagues and many many patients along the south coast of Hampshire and Dorset.

Reece had been very positively fighting cancer for over two years and finally lost his battle in the early hours of 21st of November.

Reece had been working for Medicine Clinic Pharmacies for over 15 years and worked his way up to be the Clinical Lead Pharmacist for the company. His contribution in health care was extremely valuable in many ways. He held the position of Lead Pharmacist for the Wimborne and Ferndown Primary Care Network and assisted not only the Pharmacy he was Pharmacy Manager but also the other Pharmacies and GPs in the local area. He contributed to our Covid Vaccination fight and his support for our vaccination clinics was invaluable.

I'm Todd, and we are struggling in today's job market. I have sent out over 500 applications, and am in varying degrees of employment processes. However, even if I was hired today, I would have very little to make it through the rest of my lease, not enough to pay for my wife's Type 1 diabetes needs, nor enough groceries to keep us fed.

Insulin for Prince. Needs medicine right away.,$516 raised of $460 goal,"I already spent every dollar I have for his care. Just blood work alone. Some diabetic food that he can't chew and I feed it to him crushed up with broth. He's has no desire to eat. Ever since then it's been a struggle but he's eating twice a day. What he really needs is insulin for cats to help him feel better and more options for food. I also need to take him to the doctor again to get some more help for him. I'll be staying with him for couple weeks and want to have everything I need to get him better asap. He is an amazing guy and he is so loving and brave. He has a big heart. He loves be silly and make you laugh. Hes is so inelegant and sweet. Very dear to me. I feel so limited on how I can help him. As I was not prepared and his ketosis happened relatively fast.

Evidence Based Research in Herbal Medicine,"$125 raised of $15,000 goal","Dear friends, supporters, and fellow advocates of holistic health, I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. My name is Robert Diaz, and I am reaching out to you today with a passion that runs deep within me—a passion for alternative medicine and the profound impact it can have on people's lives. I am thrilled to announce that this year 2023, I graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Science in Alternative Medicine from the University of Everglades. However my journey in the field of holistic healing began long before that. For over 15 years, I have been immersed in the world of community herbalsm, botany, and agriculture exploring the intricate relationship between nature's remedies and our well-being based in science. It all started at age 7 in my grandparents backyard garden. I always had a fascination with plants! My dedication to expanding my knowledge led me to become a certified herbalist, having received training and accreditation from the esteemed Blue Ridge School of Herbal Medicine. Additionally, I have further honed my expertise through certifications in holistic nutrition and herbs and nutrition supplements by Expert Rating Services. These qualifications have allowed me to serve as a trusted guide, helping countless individuals discover the power of natural healing for the last 4 years in private and group settings. Throughout my journey, I have the privilege of being affiliated of esteemed organizations such as Herbalists Without Borders and the American Guild of Registered Herbalists. These affiliations have deepened my understanding and connected me with a community of like-minded practitioners, committed to making a difference in the world. In 2022, I was honored to be recognized as the Herbalist of the Year by Shoutout Magazine in Miami, a testament to the positive impact my work has had on the lives of others. This recognition, alongside my consistent five-star Google reviews and the success of my holistic skincare esty shop, has solidified my commitment to creating a lasting change in the field of alternative medicine. However, despite these achievements, I find myself facing a challenge—one that I must overcome to continue my mission. While my business may appear successful on the surface, the truth is that I am currently experiencing financial strain due to unforeseen circumstances. As an independent herbalist and holistic consultant, I rely solely on the revenue generated through my services, educational offerings, and products. Regrettably, I have found myself at a crossroads, where the lack of sufficient funds threatens to hinder my research and development efforts. This is why I am reaching out to you today, humbly asking for your support. By contributing to my GoFundMe campaign, you have the opportunity to be a catalyst for change, enabling me to invest in crucial research and development projects. Your generous donations will go directly towards acquiring new cutting-edge lab equipment, conducting clinical trials, and furthering my studies in alternative medicine independently with the University of Everglades, Herbalist without Borders non profit and conducting field research for publishing in various journals and databases. It's important to note that your support goes beyond just helping me; it will have a ripple effect on countless lives. With your contribution, we can unlock the untapped potential of holistic healing, enhancing our understanding of natural remedies, and ultimately benefiting individuals seeking alternative approaches to their health and well-being. I am proud to share that I am also a disabled Marine Veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom and served in Afghanistan. The experiences I faced during my service have only deepened my commitment to helping others find healing and wellness especially supporting veterans. It is with the same unwavering dedication that I now seek your support. Every donation, no matter how small, brings us one step closer to creating a brighter future for alternative medicine. Together, we can empower research, break new ground in holistic healing, and transform lives for longevity. Thank you for taking the time to read my story, and for considering supporting this important cause. Your generosity will not only fuel my passion but will also play a significant role in shaping the future of alternative medicine. With heartfelt gratitude, Robert M Diaz, Kongo

Help Katie get to Family Medicine Residency!!,"$545 raised of $2,500 goal","Update:
I'm so happy to have matched at my #1 choice for residency in Hendersonville, North Carolina. As I'm completing onboarding for my new position, I'm required to pay upfront for several things including: NC medical license, ACLS (advanced cardiovascular life support) certification, medical professional membership. The cost of these things alone are upwards of $500. We are also looking for housing in the area, which turns out to have a pretty high cost of living. On top of that, once we secure housing, we will need to pay 1st month's rent, security deposit, and pet deposits up front. We are living in short-term housing in Hendersonville and paying for storage units until we have a place to call home where we can unload. We are juggling everything the best that we can, but we are struggling. We would appreciate any thoughts, prayers, or financial support that our community may be able to provide. We are so thankful for the donations we've received thus far and they have allowed us to secure our current short-term housing. Thank you to everyone for being a part of our special journey!

Help aspiring surgeon study medicine in Italy,"$140 raised of $20,000 goal","Hi everyone! I’m Ally a Junior at Michigan State University majoring in Biomedical sciences. I am a first generation student and the oldest child of 6, I am trying to set a good example for my siblings by showing them no goal is too big. I recently applied to a study abroad program, and after undergoing the full application process including an interview. The program is very competitive so I honestly was pretty unsure if I would get in. I am very happy that I got in due to the fact that it is the most amazing opportunity and also there are so many different things that medical schools look for when selecting students to admit and “resilience & adaptability” is #8 out of the 15 AAMC competencies that medical schools use to assess applicants. And having to fundraise for something truly important to me definitely shows resilience and adaptability.However the expenses to go are very steep for me and my family to pay. I have a single mother who is currently raising 5 children as I previously mentioned I am the oldest and our youngest is 2. I’m reaching out on this platform because without this study abroad I will not stand out or meet the requirements of the AAMC competencies upon applying to medical school. The cost of this program is a little higher than the typical program and that is simply because it is 2 countries (Italy and Africa) and I will be apart of a medical fellowship that includes two hmx Harvard medical school courses. So, after a lot of thought I’m putting this problem in God’s hands by posting this. I hope you all have an amazing day, each and every donation is of a huge help to me.

Simon has embarked on his treatment journey - a minimum of 84 days of daily injections that hurt (the medication burns when it enters the body for about a minute), and then 84 days of observation, bloodwork, etc.

Here's the catch...the meds are unapproved in the US, so pet insurance doesn't cover them and they're very expensive. And that's where you come in.

Marley Needs Medicine,"£6,296 raised of £10,000 goal","Marley needs access to the cannabis based medicine that the NHS still cant prescribe for her as she does not fulfil all of the criteria, going the private healthcare route she can get that prescription. But it's expensive,  If you have seen the news lately you will have seen other families going through the same trouble, limited to no access and the cost of going private makes it almost impossible for most families to acquire this medicine.  I didn't want to have to do this, but Marley needs to try the medicine now and I will do whatever I need to until she gets it!  It may not work, there is no magic cure all so the fundraising might not last long or if it does the NHS may be able to finally prescribe what the law says they can.  But for now I must do all I can, to run alongside there will be fundraising nights and events (details to follow)in order to raise awareness, not only for Marley but all for all kids who need medicine. Please feel free to read on for Marley's full story x Marley is 5 yrs old, she was 2 when we discovered she was having constant focal seizure activity.  To begin with we noticed her right foot was constantly moving or twitching.  A small visit to the doctors turned into a 3 week nightmare, in 24hrs we went from the doctors surgery to North Tees Hospital, then onto James Cook Hospital, a short stop back at North Tees before an ambulance journey to the R.V.I in Newcastle. The EEG she had done in James Cook, showed that the electrical activity in her brain was in a constant state of seizure activity.  She was in the R.V.I for 2 weeks while they did scans and ran tests.  To read possible causes for Marleys constant seizure activity was horrifying, there are syndromes that cause degenerative diseases, ones that life limiting or even life ending. We were petrified.  All Marleys scans then came back clear and the tests for normal causes of such activity all came back clear too.  A neurologist gave Marley a working diagnosis of E.P.C (constant focal seizure acivity), the next step was to try and locate exactly in the brain the problem was and see if brain surgery could remove it.  Marley then started under the care of Manchesters Childrens Hospital. where they began to run longer tests and more powerful scans in the hope of finding what was going on.    In the meantime Marley has symptoms are much more evident than when she was younger, her focal epileptic activity spread and she started with different seizures and it they are constant, partials and full seizures too . Marleys mobility is seriously affected, she has real trouble balancing and walking, sometimes even sitting she can manage to fall.  She is constantly hurting herself through not being able to regulate her movements and balance, but she wont be told, she just troops on! Her fine motor skills aren't good either, she has trouble holding objects or anything requiring dexterity.  According to reports Marley has possible learning delay is, but she is in school with a lovely one to one assistant.  Although Marley is in school, we had to fight tooth and nail to get her help to manage school and not hurt herself. Manchester came back with results that Marley had too many seizure focuses around her brain, which makes surgery very unlikely due to major risk to Marley. Back to the RVI and genetics, sodium channel genes are the likely cause: where we are now....Marley is refractory to meds so far and shes had 5 of them, a lot of side effects to anti epileptic drugs have also effected her.  These side effects can cause mobility and balance issues further exacerbating Marley's problems in getting around.  To see Marley struggle walking and falling and bumping into stuff is heartbreaking but she will not stop! she gets back up and tries again...it is heartbreaking yet inspiring.  Those who know Marley up close will see her constant seizures and how the different activity causes different seizures.  For me, this next part is a no-brainer.  Marley needs a try on the cannabis medicine that has shown to have good effects on conditions and symptoms of cases the same and similar to Marley.  If it works for them when all else fails, then why not Marley? The obvious connotations of cannabis medicine is a big problem for people and misconceptions are hard to change.  It has become legal in the U.K but is only licensed to 2 epilepsy syndromes (Marley might actually come under one of these).  while this is good, its not good enough and Marley needs it now.  But, you can get it through private healthcare, again there is a 'but', and it is the cost of it.  If you have seen the news lately, you will have seen families fighting to gain access to the medicine and how they cant afford the bill and cripple themselves doing so. It is expensive and while I didn't want to do this, I didn't want to be begging anybody for anything, but we have to help Marley.  The initial funding we can cover but it adds up quickly. Marley has 2 sisters so we are a family of 5, it is almost impossible to imagine how we can keep getting it together each month. I know it isn't a magic cure all remedy and it might not work, but it really is worth a go. For Marley to be on medicine that actually works and has many less side effects than anti-epileptic drugs would be of unbelievable benefit to her. If it didn't work, it was worth the try and funding raised would be passed on to another child in need of medicine. Thanks for reading x

Thank you soooo much to everyone who has contributed to help Marley & us to access the medicine which has proved to be so life-changing for her. We continue to strive to gain access to this medicine through an NHS prescription but appreciate your help whilst we still have to fund this ourselves privately.
It really is priceless though as it has helped reduce Marley's epileptic seizures in number and severity, improved her balance and co-ordination and we have also noticed vast improvements in her conversation and concentration which has made her school life much better.  This has also made her life living with type 1 diabetes (as diagnosed mid-pandemic) much easier by reducing some of the challenges she was facing from her genetic epilepsy and associated problems. Thank you again, especially during these turbulent times Malrey & the Boultons xxx

Sacramento Street Medicine,"$1,605 raised of $5,000 goal","Our Mission:

Sacramento Street Medicine exists to provide high-quality, patient-led medical care to people experiencing homelessness. We meet the needs of the people we serve where they are – on the streets and encampments throughout Sacramento.

Our work promotes and builds trust, dignity, equity, and solidarity for everyone.
Our teams consist of healthcare professionals, students, and community members who volunteer their time in service.
Our advocacy efforts highlight the absolute need for housing, mental health care, substance use disorder treatment, and harm reduction services.
Our collaboration with other organizations and the community will allow us to remain relevant, sustainable, and transformative.
 

Our Vision:

We believe healthcare and housing are human rights.

Everyday people experiencing homelessness and poverty are unable to care for their basic needs. Without homes to live in, they are unprotected and are not safe. Without food to eat, their bodies go without proper nourishment. Without compassionate care, they struggle mentally, physically, and spiritually. 

By utilizing our education in medicine and our passion for human rights, we change lives, build services, and restore hope and power, so that one-day compassionate care will no longer need to be delivered on the streets.

Fundraising Goal:

Due to the recent storm that hit Sacramento, our unhoused community has been greatly impacted, with many losing shelter, belongings, and the ability to maintain their health. All donations will go towards purchasing tents, tarps, blankets, clothing, food, and water to the unhoused community.

Tuition for Emergency Medicine Program at Stanford,"$2,625 raised of $6,000 goal","Hello, I am Colin Lowery and I am a 15 year old sophomore attending Eastlake High School. Recently I was invited to represent the Eastlake Branch Library at the Advanced Emergency Medicine program this summer at Stanford University in collaboration with George Mason University. It is a 10 day hands-on program where high school students will be tought various medical skills by actual Stanford Medicine Faculty while living on campus. These skills include learning how to suture, splint, physically assess patients, and anatomy lessons in Human Cadaver Labs.

For as long as I can remember, I have known that I want to serve and heal others as a medical doctor and specifically a surgeon.  Unfortunately, I have spent months of my childhood in hospitals with ill family members and even as a young kid I always felt a comforting peace of mind while being at/in hospitals.  At 13, I applied and was selected as a junior volunteer at a local hospital at the earliest age applicable.  I proudly serve 3 hours a week as a pharmacy aide at Sharp Chula Vista Hospital. This experience has solidified my love for medicine and my positive self confidence that I will be a medical doctor.

Academically, I have ensured my pursuit by being a 4.3 weighted GPA student as a sophomore with 3 A.P. courses to date. My passion and motivation has yielded straight A's since middle school and is fueled by two important factors to this story: My calling to serve as a Medical Doctor and my humble desire to attend Stanford University.

In order to attend this once in a lifetime opportunity, I will need to pay $6000 for tuition. This tuition covers all education, housing, and food for the 10-day program. Based on my desire to independently make this opportunity happen, I have created this gofundme campaign. The programs deadline for enrollment payment is February 15, 2019.  

I am honored by any amount of financial help received. Please feel free to reach out and ask any questions about my story, goals, passion, program tuition costs, etc. This campaign is my own personal way of pushing myself to become better prepared for college and medical school. Thank you in advance for ANY consideration.

Keira’s NYLF Medicine Program/ UC Berkeley Camp,"$1,800 raised of $3,000 goal","Hi Friends and Family, 

I am excited about an opportunity I've been given, to represent my school at the National Youth Leadership Forum for Medicine.  I have been selected to attend a 9-day camp at the University of California, Berkeley in June based upon my exemplary academic achievements and interest in the Medical field. 

Lately, I have been thinking a lot about my future and what I envision it to be. One thing I have known for quite a while now is that I really want to pursue a career in the field of Medicine, and I feel like this opportunity could be a big step in helping me decide the path for my future.  Not only am I focused on my academics, but I am also highly involved in Soccer for my school, as well as in a club/competitive league for the past 6 years, which I also truly enjoy. 

After visiting UC Berkeley this past summer with my family, we casually toured through the campus, it gave me an exciting feeling to know that I could possibly attend this school knowing that UC Berkeley and UC Davis are my top choices for where I want to attend College at this time, especially knowing that I want to pursue a career in Medicine. 

A few things that I'll be doing at the camp will be:
- Visit a medical simulation center to train like a professional and gain hands-on experience in a variety of procedures and technologies. 
- Training and talks from real physicians.
- Engage in outdoor medicine simulations created in Collaboration with
- Tour the Medical School to learn from medical students and staff to share their experience and perspective in Medical School and key success factors. 
- Learn about Medical School application process, and explore the many career options available.



With this invitation to attend this program, also comes with a price tag that I alone with my parents cannot afford all by ourselves in this short amount of time before the camp begins. I am reaching out to all of you humbly asking for your help in achieving my dreams for my future. 

I am very grateful for any help you can give in helping me to attend this program that I have been selected for.  


Many thanks with love¬ Keira

Phelecia Hatch's Cancer Medicine,"$19,860 raised of $15,000 goal","We asked Phelecia's friends and family to describe her in a few words — each response was overwhelmingly about love, family, and spirituality — describing her as ""the most kind-hearted, selfless person"", ""the sweetest nurturing spirit you will ever meet"", and ""a spiritual giant""... to name a few.

Phelecia has devoted her entire life to family and to being a devoted disciple of Jesus Christ. She is an inspiring homemaker who raised all 7 of her children in their meager 600 sq foot home while her husband, Brent, worked hard cleaning carpets and detailing cars to support the family. Always rich with love, the Hatch family has unceasingly been a beacon of light to all those around them.

Just last month, their youngest child moved out of the house. Phelecia & Brent had just entered a joyous time of life — celebrating a successful life of parenthood, and finally being able to return their focus on each other. This happy chapter quickly came to an end.

Phelecia was diagnosed last week, at 53 years old, with a rare form of progressed Stage 3 stomach cancer (a very aggressive cancer with a 5 year survival rate below 19%). This came after being extremely ill and weak over the last couple of months.

Because Brent has been self-employed his entire life, they chose a more affordable option of health insurance, which to their dismay,  does not cover Phelecia's prescription medications.

They have been told that they will need to sell everything to pay for Phelecia's cancer treatments. While we pray this isn't true, the message is clear: Phelecia's medicine that costs over $1,500 each month — the medicine that will help keep her alive — is an unsustainably high price for the self-paying Hatch family.

The Hatch’s are in need of your ministering love. They have asked only for your positive thoughts and prayers. But we want to bless them even more with our loving actions in this time of need.

If you feel called to help, then please consider donating funds to help Phelecia afford her cancer medicine. Even the smallest amount will help her get through one more day. Sharing this page is also an amazing way to help. Thank you so much for your love and light during this time of deep heartache. Blessings to you and yours.

Medical Bills for Josalyn,"$40,135 raised of $100,000 goal","Wendy gave birth to Josalyn, a beautiful baby girl on 8/15. Labor was induced because in late June during an unplanned hospitalisation, a heart defect was discovered, AVSD.

An atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) is a heart defect in which there are holes between the chambers of the right and left sides of the heart, and the valves that control the flow of blood between these chambers may not be formed correctly. Additionally, she has significant mitral valve regurgitation (blood is going the wrong way from the heart, flooding her lungs) and her PDA is still open.

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is an extra blood vessel found in babies before birth and just after birth. In most babies who have an otherwise normal heart, the PDA will shrink and close on its own in the first few days of life. If it stays open longer, it may cause extra blood to flow to the lungs (which we have). Problems are most likely if the PDA is large.

Davina Licon's Medical Expenses,"$36,338 raised of $100,000 goal","My name is Blanca Navarro and I organized this fundraiser for my daughter, Davina Licon. On April 7, 2023, our beloved Davina was a victim of an attempted murder while leaving the 24-Hour Fitness Center. A man wearing a mask fired a gun at her and doused her in acid. She suffers from severe chemical burns on over 30 percent of her body. She is in critical condition in the ICU. She is still currently hospitalized and has had three surgeries so far. The trauma she has endured is unimaginable. She will have physical, mental, and emotional scars for the rest of her life. She suffers from P.T.S.D. and will need ongoing therapy even after she gets out of the hospital. Davina is a strong, disciplined, hardworking individual who was two weeks away from competing in her first fitness competition. Unfortunately, her dreams are on hold due to this brutal attack. She will have a long and difficult road to recovery, requiring multiple surgeries. Funds from this account will go toward her ongoing medical expenses and therapy. Please consider helping ease the financial burden on this family of her medical expenses. Any amount you're willing to contribute is greatly appreciated. Our family also would like to send a special thank you to everyone that has donated so far. We ask that you please share with friends and family and keep our beloved daughter and sister in your prayers during this devastating time.

Jan AP Kaczmarek Medical Fund,"$51,913 raised of $60,000 goal","As some of you know, my seemingly-indefatigable Dad, Jan, has been very ill for quite some time. He has Multiple System Atrophy, or MSA, for which there is no real treatment or cure. The disease chips away at your nerve endings, until your lungs fail. It has been a horror for us as a family to watch this amazing man fight an unbeatable battle. All attempts to help him improve have failed, and now the goal is to keep him as comfortable as possible at home. My Dad is unable to get around on his own and requires the help of his wife and two caregivers to perform basic tasks, such as getting out of bed or getting dressed. He requires lots of assistance from other people and also equipment, such as a wheelchair. He cannot be left alone, because he often loses consciousness due to swings in blood pressure. Dad is also no longer able to work, and his wife has had to put her work on hold as she is his primary caregiver, which is a full-time job, on top of caring for their 7-year-old son. This has created a lot of strain on them financially, as they fight to keep Dad around as long as possible as his needs grow. We – myself and my siblings and his wife - have chased down every possibility, and have done what we can to help them financially, but his needs have outstripped our ability. This is why I am asking for help with his care. Dad’s health is reaching a point where he will need more specialized nursing care, another caregiver, and more assistive equipment and therapies to make it possible for him to remain at home with his wife and child, which he desperately wants. Any amount helps, truly. But even if you just send him a text or an email to tell him you’re thinking of him, I know that also means the world to him. I will receive all funds and wire them to his wife’s account. She has been managing his care with such grace and commitment, and we want to support her as much as possible. Thank you, Ana

Medical Fundraiser for Oliver Kita,"$45,240 raised of $125,000 goal","Hi, my name is Julie Gerngross Baker. I am a close personal friend of Oliver Kita and his husband Kevin Kraft.

I can guarantee that you probably know Oliver too—or at the very least, you know him as a dedicated community member, chef and restauranteur of Heaven (Woodstock), renowned chocolatier, celebrated caterer, teacher (Culinary Institute) and artist. However what you might not know is that Oliver is facing a sudden life-threatening illness that has forced him to close his beloved Hudson Valley business, Oliver Kita Fine Chocolates.

Oliver has been hospitalized since the beginning of October with late stage liver disease. Even with insurance, the medical bills are mounting. His recovery will entail additional expenses unlikely to be covered by his insurance, so we are forced to crowd fund to ensure that Oliver receives the critical care that he needs and to curtail the burdens of the American medical system from taking everything that he and Kevin have worked so hard to build as a family.

The next 24-48 hours are going to be crucial for Danny and his recovery.

Unfortunately, Danny did not have health insurance mainly because he owns his own business. We all know that his medical bills will be unfathomable. Mandy has yet to leave his side since the accident happened. With Danny being out of work and Mandy being by his side during this crucial part of his recovery, Mandy will also not be working. We, as close family and friends wanted to create this fundraiser to help take the financial burden off of Mandy so she can focus on being there for her husband and 3 children.

Medical Freedom For Noah,"$13,046 raised of $50,000 goal","***EMERGENCY FUND, SAVE NOAH MCADAMS****

Noah was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia on April 4th, 2019 at Johns Hopkins All Childrens Hospital. 

Our whole stay was absolutely terrible with lack of communication, poor infection control, no informed consent on procedures and drugs, rude staff and dangerous mistakes on the hospitals end.

Needless to say, with over 30 documented disturbing issues with JHACH, we sought out a second opinion and a new provider and JH was not happy about it! We were told by JH that there was no second opinion and that the only protocol available was chemotherapy, period. 

They decided to call CPS and Tampa PD claiming that we were refusing treatment all around and that Noah was in life-threatening conditions, and gravely ill, which was so far from the truth. 

My sweet, handsome little boy Noah was taken from my husband and I on April 30th at 7PM by the state of Kentucky and the state of Florida for ""medical neglect,"" as we were seeking a second opinion on the protocol for his cancer diagnosis.

When they had him tested at the hospital in Kentucky, his levels were AMAZING and he was in EXCELLENT health.

Then they proceeded to place him in a foster care home overnight, rather than remain in the hospital. 

Johns Hopkins All Childrens Hospital in St Pete lied to the authorities about Noah’s condition and us notifying them about seeking a second opinion and now our child has been away from us for 2 weeks as of the opening of this donation fund. This is known as medical kidnapping. 

We are requesting your help as our online community to raise funds for lawyer fees (as we plan to take this all the way to the Supreme Court), medical expenses, alternative/healing therapies, a perfect new home for our little man to come home to (as we are currently living with family), and help us to heal and spend time together as a family when we get Noah back. Both my husband and I have taken time away from work to dedicate ourselves exclusively to this cause for freedom for Noah, to be at every single court hearing (that they keep giving us a day or twos notice for), to be at every single doctors appointments, and to take this as far legally, as we need to, to ensure this STOPS HAPPENING TO CHILDREN EVERYWHERE. 

Feel free to follow Noah's Facebook page to get the back story and current updates and share, share, share!

She is the light of our lives and the most beautiful little girl. We aren’t typically the people to ask for this kind of thing but God has a way of humbling you when it comes to your babies.

We haven’t shared much about her medical information with many people other than immediate family but we are now needing help for costs that insurance won’t cover.

When Lakyn was around 3 months old I had a feeling that something was just off, I couldn’t really explain it other than something just didn’t seem right. So, after switching doctors a few times we ended up at Shands in Gainesville and they have been magnificent. Lakyn has been diagnosed with a Genetic Brain Abnormality, Seizures, Torticollus, Atrial Septal Defect in her heart, Microcephaly, Global Developmental Delays, Vision Impairment, Placiogephaly, her head size is in the less than 1%, and Muscle Spasticity. She has had an MRI on her brain, surgery to correct lip and tongue tie, a hospital stay for the seizure, multiple rounds of blood work, patching of her eye, has been fitted for ankle braces, a Benik Suit, will be getting an assisted standing device soon, and is currently undergoing Genetic Testing with Ryan and I in an attempt to find a diagnosis for her condition. She is currently under the care of Neurology, Genetics, Opthemology, ENT, Ortho, Cardiology, and her incredible Pediatrician, as well as currently going to physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy twice a week.

My husband, Chuck (pictured above after his coronary bypass surgery in 2020), has recently gone into stage 5 kidney failure (end stage). He is having his dialysis catheter placed today to start long term dialysis treatments. We are lucky in that he has short term disability benefits through work, so we'll be getting 2/3 of his normal salary, and we have excellent insurance as well as Medicare for the hospital stays - but we know that there will be out of pocket costs that we won't be able to cover. At this time we don't even know if he'll be able to return to work at all. There is no cushion to manage the additional medical bills, as I put everything I earn back into the business to help expand it and find new things to offer to you, and the short paychecks will only pay our bills and feed the family. Without your assistance, Tatting Corner and the Craft Corner are both at risk of closing, as I would need to return to the workforce to earn the additional money that the hospitals will demand, and that we don't have the means to pay, even on a payment arrangement. Please understand, Tatting Corner and the Craft Corner are absolutely doing fine. It's just a matter of not wanting to bleed the businesses for these medical bills, so that the businesses don't suffer. We are already being hit with demands to pay current medical bills, so it's becoming an urgent issue for us.

Support Elizabeth's Medical Journey,"$13,326 raised of $50,000 goal","Hi, my name is Tina Minges and my husband is Dave, we are hoping to share ourgranddaughter's medical journey. Elizabeth is our sweet, brave and strong 3-year-old granddaughter and she is currently and indefinitely on life support at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. Though Elizabeth is as tough as nails, the upcoming medical expenses will place an enormous burden on their family.

Earlier this week, Elizabeth fell ill and was taken to a local hospital where she was given steroids and sent home. Within 24 hours, we rushed her to the emergency room at Cincinnati Children's Hospital after her symptoms worsened. She was extremely lethargic with labored breathing and blue lips. With extremely low oxygen levels, she was admitted to the ICU and we later discovered that she had pneumonia, MRSA in her nose and she became septic. She was intubated and induced into a coma after coding and needing CPR for 6 minutes. Her lungs and heart quickly stopped functioning and an ECMO machine is keeping her alive while she slowly strengthens her heart and lungs. She has also had a heart procedure to search for a blood clot that was never found. Due to the induced coma and swelling, she began dialysis this morning. As many of our loved ones know, Elizabeth has always been such a strong baby girl since birth and this will not be any different. She is such a fighter.

Erich Petersen - Medical Assistance Fund,"$90,385 raised of $100,000 goal","On August 18, 2023, 19 year-old Erich, was full of excitement. He had alot to be thankful for. He was starting his sophomore year at Colorado Mesa University (CMU), moving into his first apartment (finally out of the dorms) and getting ready for his 20th birthday. He was excited to play Lacrosse (#18 if you want to know) for a second year at CMU with his older brother Philip. He was excited to do what college kids do – go out, have fun, laugh, play, adventure – the
things we all did in college, without a care in the world. He had everything he owned packed into the family’s old Ford Excursion ready to continue this life he had only just begun to live on his own.

Colby Maury-Rice's medical and family expenses,"$17,495 raised of $500,000 goal","Colby Maury-Rice's medical and family expenses
Colby Maury-Rice is a recent graduate of Sacred Heart Catholic High School, where I used to teach. He enlisted in the Mississippi Army National Guard in April, making his twin sister, his mom, and his retired Army (combat wounded-disabled) stepfather quite proud. His dream has been to become a combat medic and he told his mom, ""If I can save just one soldier, it'll be worth it.""

Colby was at Camp Shelby for training--he was supposed to ship out for basic training on 21 Aug and this training was to prepare for that. During this heat wave, several young recruits have suffered heat stroke and heat exhaustion. One soldier died after a fitness run on Friday (11 Aug) and Colby suffered a heat stroke on Saturday (12 Aug). There was no ambulance on hand nor were there any medical personnel on duty. Colby's heart stopped as his temperature spiked and there was no defibrillator. Colby was transported to Forrest General Hospital in Hattiesburg and their staff have worked hard to save him. Today (19 Aug), Colby finally started breathing on his own (with the machine augmenting his efforts).

Jesse’s Medical Care,"$15,283 raised of $40,000 goal","14 days and counting, with no end in sight. Just after 6pm on Sunday the 29th, I received the call that no mother is ever prepared for. A random, good samaritan was calling to tell me that he was holding my child’s hand while applying pressure to his torso until the ambulance arrived. My son was the victim of a senseless act of violence. He was shot after being robbed of his empty wallet, coming back from the corner store at his friend’s house. The bullet entered below his left ribs, went through his spleen, pancreas, kidney, and hit his spine at L4, before exiting above the right upper buttock. My once very active teenager, is now lying in a hospital bed wondering if the pain is ever going to subside, or if he’s ever going to walk again from all of the nerve damage he has sustained. He continues to slowly improve every day, but this is just the beginning of a very long road ahead of us. He will be needing continuous medical care and assistance, physical therapy, and occupational therapy for at least the next year or so. The medical bills are piling up faster than I can keep track of and I’m just not sure where we go from here. This is just heartbreaking to watch your child look so defeated.","Los Angeles, CA"

Jona's Medical Bills and Recovery,"$5,116 raised of $14,385 goal","Hi, I am Jona, a poet and writer. Recently, I was hospitalized and now face the long road to recovery and stabilization. Thanks to my fantastic care team, I sustained no permanent injury.

But now comes the hard part: I must pay all the bills while trying to find a new place to live. Homelessness is no fun, but it has its bright side. You get to learn more about people and their life.

I received a crash course in humility that I desperately needed, but it did not relieve the pain of sleeping on the floor. Nor does it cure the severe chronic pain, clinical depression, and anxiety that I suffer from each day.
