What I mean; if the specific medication is being prescribed for a specific medical condition that a limited number of people have. And only that medication really treats the symptoms or can stop the chronic condition from worsening. Then what often can be found by first asking your Dr. and also doing some research on the internet. Is there are companies; organizations; foundations that offer copay assistance. Literally what they do is pay for the medication in full. Normally it has to be renewed     go online and search for help paying for xxxx where xxxx is the medication name You will probably be surprised by what how simple it is to apply; but don’t start this process unless you can find recent tax returns and supporting documents. IMO the manufacturers and distributors know that most of their customers have Rx insurance so they can get good publicity by offering substantial discounts. A between job friend was able to get a $50;000/year list price med for about $50 a month several years ago. If you are fortunate you might get a similar deal - so go ahead. Good luck.

Ask a pharmacist for other ideas. Check Amazon’s prices for prescription items. If the prescription is a very expensive brand name; the manufacturer will likely help you — not directly; as that would violate Medicare rules; but through a subsidiary corporation that they support. It may take several calls to the manufacturer to find it; but there is almost always one out there. And; if you are Medicare eligible; there are Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare part D. Good luck!Yes there are many ways to get help paying for your prescriptions. Besides what was mentioned in the other excellent answers to your question; there are some other ways. There are some mail order pharmacies. I'm not referring to the ones owned by the large insurance companies like Optum. Mark Cuban opened one that offers the major generic drugs at reduced prices. He charges less to fill a script and has a smaller markup than the national pharmacy chains. The success of his new venture means he will be carrying moe drugs.

When I was extremely deep in debt; I actually had three jobs. One in the morning; one in the evening; and one on the weekends. And it sucked. It was horrible. But I paid my bills. And as soon as I paid them; I quit two of those jobs. And most importantly; I learned to not be stupid; and get my dumb butt into debt again. That’s actually more important than figuring out how to pay your debts. Because the only thing that’s about twenty times worse than going through a hard and difficult time; is not learning anything; and having to go through it aga          One man who was deaf and unable to speak walked through the neighborhood with a big jar filled with pocketchange…just coins…knocked on the door and gave me a note his wife needed heart meds and was in the “donut section” of medicare; he was shocked when I gave him several dollars and had tears rolling down. It is difficult now to come up with real money as I just use credit cards that have autopay from the bank. But that is one way. The other way is something I used; one Rx was $399 a month so I called the pharmaceutical company and am getting it direct shipment for $99. When I still worked as

Read that again. Because WE let them. Medicare Part D specifically PROHIBITS the negotiation of drug prices. (Some Big Pharma lobbyist; somewhere; broke out the champagne and got a huge bonus for that one.) Just about every other country in the world; where universal health care exists; negotiates their drug costs. Those countries know that saying that the system pays only X dollars for Y drug means that effectively; that drug won’t go anyone in that country; unless Big Pharma plays ball.                                     If you are in the United States there are a variety of discount programs. One which has gotten a lot of press lately was started by famous billionaire Mark Cuban. Many people with health insurance use those programs because they find the prescriptions cost less using thoseprograms than using their health insurance. Here is a lsit of some of them— Here is another list—

There are so many middle men getting rich off of the sick. In the United States; there’s seems to be an attitude that only some people deserve healthcare. Poor people die unnecessarily. They can’t afford to get help when their illness is in the treatable stage. They can’t afford treatments because of copays and deductibles. There is a large portion of the population that are really ok with this. It is sad and disheartening. They are so concerned that someone they deem unworthy might get the help they need. “How

A doctor (or “provider”) ordered the treatment. It has become way too common for docs to ordered the absolute latest treatment; with the presumption that it is also the best. With malpractice attorneys outnumbering doctors; if a treatment is 1% less effective (in a trial done by the drug company); the chance of it being ordered is low. Drug companies want the return on their investment to be as large as possible. Or larger. They largely spend their advertising money to market their drugs directly to consumers (that’s you); not to doctors.

Tell the government you it can control prices or quantities and it tries to do so. Often making the original problem worse. Price caps cause in drug shortages. Do we really want more drug shortages?

Drug companies don’t have just one drug they could research. It isn’t like they sit and think “hey; little Jonny has this disease and I bet if we think really hard we could cure it.” Nope. They have a whole list of possible drugs they could research; each with its own chance of success; potential number of people to help; and each with its own cost to research. This is true in both the government-run approach; the free market approach; and every point in between. You cannot get around these basic                Rising medication costs are at the forefront of news reports; as drastic increases are creating roadblocks for patients to receive proper health care treatment. Even with prescription insurance assistance; patients are bearing more of the cost-sharing burden; which results in prescriptions not being filled; and in turn; conditions and illness going untreated.

Europe demands drugs to cross 2 additional hurdles beyond randomized clinical trials. 1. For a drug to be in the market it needs to be cost-effective at a reasonable willingness to pay thresh-hold (about twice the per-capita GDP for every life year saved). In other words the new drugs have to justify the high price by demonstrating how much the more effective the drug is are compared to the ""current standard therapy"" and not just PLACEBO. 2. Even if the drug is deemed ""cost effective""; there needs to be a budget impact analysi     My personal list of actions I think would lower drug prices for US consumers: 1. Ban direct-to-consumer drug advertising. 2. Allow Medicare/Medicaid to negotiate drug prices. 3. Allow importation of prescription medications. 4. Allow the FDA to refuse to approve ""me; too!"" new drug applications unless the company can prove the innovator product represents a significant therapeutic advance."

Adherence to treatment: Effective medication management ensures that patients adhere to their prescribed treatment plans. Non-adherence; such as skipping doses or not taking medications as directed; can lead to worsened health conditions; increased hospitalizations; and the need for more extensive treatments. By promoting adherence; medication management can help prevent costly complications and reduce the overall healthcare expenditure. 2. Avoidance of medicati

The U.S. has chosen to insert a whole industry into the value chain of health care. That industry does not provide any value to consumers; doctors; health care institutions or society. It does not improve overall care or health outcomes but it does cost an immense amount of money. That industry is the Health Care Insurance industry.

I've had Percocet in the hospital before and that got me high but gave me a ton of pain relief. We switched because of how much it helped in the hospital. In the hospital they offered me 10mg but the first time I took it I just took 5mg so I could see how much it helped. It worked great but I was in severe pain and it brought me down to able to hold a convo so an hour later I took the second and that brought me down to able to sleep.

First; there is a need to advocate for the importance of these medications in treating addiction; increasing awareness among policymakers; insurers; and healthcare professionals. Policy reform is crucial; focusing on simplifying and expediting the authorization process; along with pushing for regulations that prioritize patient well-being and evidence-based treatments. Collaboration between healthcare providers; addiction specialists; and insurers; coupled with improved communicatio There's a couple options that I'm personally aware of. Basically it's a program where a physician prescribes an opiate blocker to an addict. The medicine will prevent the ability to get a “high” from the drugs the addict uses. It also will make detox from the illicit substances all but non-existant; causing the transition to sober-medically assisted living easier. The doctor will start a new patient on a fairly low dose; gradually increasing until there's little to no withdrawl symptoms and their urge to use is minimal. When they “level out”; the patient usually earns priviliges i.e. take home

However; the year 2023 has seen an alarming increase in the number of drug shortages in the U.S. According to recent reports; more than 100 drugs are currently experiencing shortages in the country. This has led to an increasing concern for the availability of life-saving medicines and treatments. One of the main reasons for the drug shortages in 2023 is the growing demand for medications; particularly due to the aging population. As a result; the demand has surpassed the supply; and manufacturers are struggl    Unfortunately there is no good answer to this question. In recent years; some older drugs have become less popular; and as a result; fewer manufacturers were making them. A couple of years ago; Mylan was the only maker for several older antipsychotic drugs; and they had an inspection problem at one of their factories. They closed the factory and fixed the problem; but it took the better part of a year; and during that time those drugs were unavailable. The obvious answer is; “switch to a similar drug.” But drugs that are similar in theory don’t always suit a particular patient in real life. One

So we don't want to treat addiction at its root cause; just treat after the fact? I guess addiction is unstoppable. I guess we're no longer looking for solutions; just treatment because addiction is a foregone conclusion. Good luck with that.it was the paycheck I was after when I went to work over there.

Paying a decent salary and a per diem to compensate travel across jurisdiction would have attracted talent instead of giving me a reason to quit.

Which will end up being my third largest monthly expense this month; behind my mortgage and HOA fees. Because I am a type 1 diabetic; I am forever being dispatched to specialists to “check something out”. Most of them amount to hanging around some creepy as specialists office for an hour to be told “It’s nothing” and then $70 for the copay on the visit.

In the U.S.; the multimillionaires and billionaires only want government to supply a robust defense. They can self-fund most of their other needs.

There is a website called Prescription Prices; Coupons & Pharmacy Information - GoodRx ; and they show you several prices at nearby drug stores and the price of a specific quantity of medicine when you input the name of the medication; the number of milligrams and the amount prescribed your MD prescribed for you! Walmart and Target are not always the cheapest pharmacies. Here are some prices for the Ventolin HFA 90 mcg Inhaler 18 gm size in New Haven; Connecticut. Big Y-$43.12 Target-$42.13 ShopRite-$42.37 RiteAid-$14.42 Costco-$43.29 Walgreens-$15.54 Walmart-12.01 Stop and Shop-$42.47 CVS-41.50 As you can see from the prices listed on one medication; the cost range spans from twelve dollars to about 43.00 for the same medicine. These price fluctuations are common because some stores will give a customer a low price the first time and raise the price for the refills after the initial prescription has been filled; and these prices are all for the brand-name drug.

Why would it take a small country of 37 million people to provide a cut-rate back door low cost source of exactly the same drugs are you currently over pay for? The answer is probably that Congress is afraid to regulate Big Pharma to modest profits. Apparently Big Pharma and privately delivered healthcare owns Congress.

https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-medications-that-are-incredibly-expensive-but-are-incredibly-cheap-to-make,What are some medications that are incredibly expensive but are incredibly cheap to make,There are a number of medications that fit this description; including certain cancer drugs; insulin; and HIV medications. For example; some cancer drugs can cost tens of thousands of dollars per dose; while the raw materials to make them may only cost a few dollars. Similarly; insulin; which is a life-saving medication for people with diabetes; can cost hundreds of dollars per vial; even though it costs less than $5 to produce. In addition; some HIV medications can cost hundreds of dollars per pill; despite the fact that the raw ingredients are inexpensive. This discrepancy can be attributed Most medications are dirt cheap to make. Big pharma knows that they can put whatever price they want on their stuff; and most pay for it through insurance and co-pays. Where else are you going to get the drugs if not through them? They’re regulated by the government; but still priced way too high. By the time everyone gets there cut; from manufacturing; to distribution; the end user is getting screwed with prices.
https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-cheaper-to-buy-certain-prescription-medications-without-using-health-insurance,Why is it cheaper to buy certain prescription medications without using health insurance,It is possible that the insurance plan you have is specifically designed so that you must pay the stated copay; even if the cost of the drug is less. What you are referring to in your $45 copay is called a “clawback”. The insurer who is covering your prescriptions has an agreement with the pharmacy that the pharmacy (or more likely; the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM)); will send the $18 that you pay over and above the regular charge for the drug to the insurance company who underwrites your plan. The reason for what happened on the compound could be that the pharmacy charges the insurance compa        Paperwork. The US insurance model is ridiculously bureaucratic - and the paperwork has to be paid for. When going through the pharmacist over the counter the people involved are you; the pharmacist; and the wholesaler. It’s a simple transaction where there’s almost no paperwork to be filled out (little more than any other shopping trip or amazon purchase). When using your insurance you present your money and your insurance to the pharmacist. They then need to fill out the paperwork for the insurance company. The insurance company then checks it and might send it back rejected for a simple mistak

Firstly; the pharmaceutical industry incurs substantial expenses in research and development to bring new drugs to market. These costs are often passed on to consumers. Additionally; aggressive marketing campaigns further escalate overall drug prices. Secondly; the lack of price regulation in the U.S. allows pharmaceutical companies to set their own prices without government intervention; unlike in many other countries where drug prices Because we let them. Read that again. Because WE let them. Medicare Part D specifically PROHIBITS the negotiation of drug prices. (Some Big Pharma lobbyist; somewhere; broke out the champagne and got a huge bonus for that one.) Just about every other country in the world; where universal health care exists; negotiates their drug costs. Those countries know that saying that the system pays only X dollars for Y drug means that effectively; that drug won’t go anyone in that country; unless Big Pharma plays ball.

Several factors contribute to the reliability of a pharmaceutical supplier; including their adherence to regulatory standards; reputation in the industry; and the quality of their products. Some of the best and most reliable suppliers of pharmaceutical medications are well-established companies with a strong track record of delivering high-quality products. These companies often invest heavily in research and development to ensure the efficacy and safety of their         Pharmas are for-profit corporations; which means their primary duty is to shareholders. They are operated to make as much money as possible; that is job #1. So when there’s a conflict between making something cheaply and making something safe; guess which one wins? But I’m straying from my point. Pharma products are priced based on what the market will bear; so the US system of “health insurance” is a gold mine for them; the market is no longer driven by the finances of individuals; it now taps a collective with very deep pockets. Without “insurance” who would be able to pay $125K for a round o

Generic Medications: When a brand-name medication's patent expires; other manufacturers can produce generic versions; which are often significantly cheaper due to competition. 2.

Steer clear from CVS. Especially if it involves controlled substance medications. All big chain pharmacies; from my experience; are very deceptive and don’t have any morals. If a physician has ordered said medication to that specific pharmacy they have an obligation to dispense the drug.

However; some pharmaceutical companies are known for producing generic drugs and offering more affordable options.

Some notable pharmaceutical companies with a focus on affordability include:Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (Israel): Teva is one of the largest generic drug manufacturer I’m not sure what you’re asking.

It is VERY complicated. An obvious reason why the rates of pharmaceutical drugs are sometimes exorbitantly high is the share contributed from it to the research and development of the medical field. Yet; a farrago of additional elements such as insurance and intermediaries; alongside traditional market factors such as demand; scarcity and competition; play a significant role in the ever so dynamic pricing of drugs.  Breaking It Down Much like a traditional supply chain; the drug manufactu      Most medicines are cheap to produce. However; medicines are very; very expensive to develop. Typically; a dozen or two new chemical entities are approved annually (in the US). Divided into the R&D costs of the industry; cost to develop generally exceeds a billion dollars and takes 8–10 years. The producer then has the balance of the patent life to recover costs. Pricing is based on the cost of the available alternatives. If a drug prevents; say; a three-day hospitalization; it might be worth thousands of dollars. When the patent expires; cost will drop to a value closer to the cost of productio

I'm not sure this has much to do with the price directly; but for quality control purposes; it is probably cheaper to not have such an exact standard. I don't have any issue with generics.

A lot depends on your insurance or if you are self pay. If you have insurance then you have a pharmacy benefit manager. He negotiates prices with the various pharmacies and drug companies in order to “save” you money. It may be that you would pay less copay at times for a specific brand name drug than you might for a generic. I have seen people pay $35 copays at a pharmacy that were on their $4 cash price list. The mistake the patient made was using his insurance card. The pharmacist justified the 35$ by telling the patient about all the forms he has to

No; they are not buying off the black market; or buying inferior or outdated product. I answered this many times when I worked in the pharmacy. Without giving away proprietary information; I can tell you that Costco's markup on pharmaceutical drugs is kept very low; keeping in line with their general pricing structure. Most pharmacies keep afloat by instituting high margins on cheap generics; because that is how they make money. Brand name drugs have little markup- the pharmacy is paying their depot about as much as they charge. There is a little wiggle room      Sadly; there's no simple rule when it comes to prescription drug prices. Every drug is priced differently; and each drug needs to be considered separately if you're looking to maximize your savings. We've spent the last 2 years studying drug prices (I'm a co-founder of GoodRx - our company is laser-focused on prescription drug price transparency). We've found that consumers can save by: a) switching pharmacies (some pharmacies have low cash prices) b) using available discounts ($4 generic programs; coupons; etc) c) going generic vs brand d) switching to a lower-cost theraputic alternative It's t

https://www.quora.com/Why-are-generic-medicines-so-much-cheaper-than-prescription-medicines-Is-it-the-formulation,Why are generic medicines so much cheaper than prescription medicines Is it the formulation,It's because the brand-name company was the first one to discover and patent the drug. The laws then protect their patent for a certain amount of time; and during that time no generic copies of it can be made. This is the brand-name company's chance to make lots of money back on the drug to replace all the money they spent on researching and developing the new drug; etc. They're allowed to set their own price for the drug. Once the patent runs out; generic companies can now put out their own version of the drug; which are traditionally much cheaper because the various generic companies compete Generic medicines are typically significantly cheaper than prescription medicines due to several factors related to their development; production; and marketing. These factors include the absence of research and development costs; competition; and regulatory considerations. Here are some key reasons why generic medicines are more affordable:

https://www.quora.com/Why-are-medicines-so-expensive-and-not-cheaper-for-the-working-class-and-poor,Why are medicines so expensive and not cheaper for the working class and poor,In the UK medicines cost £9.30 (roughly $12.5) per item unless you are exempt. That exemption with cover most of the poor. In fact about 60% of the population is exempt for one reason or anotherThe cost of medicine could be lowered drastically by simply lengthening the time of patent protection. Drug companies have massive R&D expenses. Not all drugs come to market; so the R&D for the ones that don’t have to be recovered through sales of the ones that do. By the time the company goes through testing and trials and gets approval; they have only 3 years or so of patent protection left. If patent protection were extended by as little as five more years; the amortization costs of the R&D would be spread out more and the per pill cost would come down.

That’s the hard part. A few have complex ingredients that are expensive to produce; but most of them do not. So drugs have a very low marginal cost (the cost required to produce an additional unit). Remember that with drugs; it’s not just the R&D that went into the successful drug; it’s the R&D that went into all the drugs that didn’t end up working. So the drug company needs to recover its large fixed costs. It does this by charging a lot for each drug — much more than it costs to actually manufacture the product.

Because WE let them. Medicare Part D specifically PROHIBITS the negotiation of drug prices. (Some Big Pharma lobbyist; somewhere; broke out the champagne and got a huge bonus for that one.) Just about every other country in the world; where universal health care exists; negotiates their drug costs. Those countries know that saying that the system pays only X dollars for Y drug means that effectively; that drug won’t go anyone in that country; unless Big Pharma plays ball.                                     There are two main drivers: strict enforcement of liberal intellectual property laws; and political restriction of bargaining power. The grant of a patent on a drug compound gives its owner a monopoly for the lifetime of the patent; which is now 20 years. During this time the patent holder is free to charge as much as they believe the market will bear without the threat of being undercut by competition. This is not quite as bad as it sounds - drugs are patented before they receive FDA clearance for marketing; so the effective life of the monopoly is usually on the order of 10–16 years; not 20.

It’s hard to understand; but a person who is addicted to a substance (or a behavior; for that matter) has undergone fundamental changes in their brain structure; specifically; the reward pathways in the brain have begun to overpower most of the other cognitive functions. Essentially; an addicted person’s brain places drugs on the same level as food; air; or sleep; an instinct-driven necessity for survival. I had to explain that to demonstrate the mindset of an unemployed person who is        Living a parasitic lifestyle is pretty much the norm.

When I was getting high; I “borrowed"" money from every single person that I knew; with zero intention of ever paying it back. When I reached a point where nobody would lend me any more; I skipped town and started somewhere else. So I'm not sure to whom you're referring; but if anybody ever paid you back; then either A) it was years later; after they'd gotten clean; or B) they weren't really addicts; they just might've been a few bucks shy for weed money.A white addict I know borrowed $5 from me 40 years ago. He still hasn’t paid me back."

It starts out small; maybe digging through the sofa cushions for spare change. Then it's the bank account and before you know it; the credit cards are maxed out. Time to start begging; borrowing; and stealing. We addicts are great story tellers. Came up a bit short; just need a

I started out on pain pills. I paid $5 a piece on the street for 10mg tabs and $6 for percsl. But that was years ago. These days they're selling for $10-$15 a piece which is nuts because I was doing about 60 a day. Then I smoked crack for a while. $25 at a time was enough to make me want more. $50 was straight. But this was at least once a day and sometimes twice. Spice was pretty expensive. Pre rolled blunts that I bought from my Uncle Stanley were $5 a piece. If he was out I bought $30 bags from down the street. I smoked about      I was once addicted to pain killers (Opiates). First I will say; In my early twenties I was very adventurous and open to trying about anything when it came to recreational drugs. None of which I became addicted to because I did not like the way most made me feel and that was enough to keep me from continuing to take them. Opiates though; I absolutely loved how they made me feel. At first I would take a couple 5mg Vicodin (hydrocodone) every once in a while as I enjoyed the euphoria induced by them. I can describe the effects as feeling a warm sensation all over my body. They uplifted my mood; ga

However; it has been shown that approximately fourteen percent of those on the street lost their housing due to substance abuse. As a person is on the street longer; the more likely it is that they will be addicted to a drug. Chronic houseless individuals are much more likely to be addicted than a person on the street for a year or less. This is because drugs or alcohol are being used as a way to ease the pain of living on the street; esp    I used to own an apartment building next door to which the landlord let lots of druggies move in. Until we got it cleaned up; my tenants and I had lots of opportunity to watch the life cycles of these losers. We all estimated that on average; they spent about 97% of their time looking for food; looking for something to steal; fighting; usually noisily; crashed; sitting in urgent care. Day and night no longer have meaning; screaming; working on their car or more likely bicycle-with the radio on—all at 3 am or whenever. That for 163 hours a week; so they can spend 5 hours high.

Who wouldn't want the feeling that everything will be alright and things aren't so bad ; u can talk to people have energy almost feel human!!!! I crave drugs everyday and I basically would take anything to control the demons in my headWhen a person on the street asks me for money to get something to eat; but I notice they're shaking; I know the money is for booze or drugs. But I give them a couple bucks anyway. It is still a way of helping someone find relief of suffering agony. They are usually are homeless. I grew up poor; but never went without what I needed. I still wonder if I could handle being homeless and caring if I were sober or not.
https://www.quora.com/What-makes-a-drug-addictive,What makes a drug addictive,Psychological addiction is a mental dynamic that happens not only with drugs but all sorts of things. We all have things in our lives that are painful or uncomfortable to think about and either come to accept or work to solve. Sometimes; we want to avoid these things; so we look for something that will take our minds away from them. This can be drugs or alcohol; but also food; sleep; video games; TV; reading; sex; or any number of other things. Sometimes; we keep choosing the distraction over dealing with it again and again. The more you do that; the harder it is to solve it; because you're dev     It's all fun and games at first. Most people start via snorting or smoking it and try to have certain “NEVERS” like never using needles; never letting it affect their kids; never letting it affect their careers; etc…; but then all those “NEVERS” start to fall away as the drug starts to affect the physiology of the brain and body. So before you know it; you're using needles because you're only going to try it once and that turns to twice and so on. Needles are illegal to buy in many states; so you get them where you can and from who you can and use them over and over again until they're dull and

When I was an addict; some of the things I did; was ask for money at gas stations saying my car broke down and was out of gas and I had no money. Another was buying drugs from my dealer in the ghetto; and then selling them for three times as much in the suburbs. Another one was working for people ( addicts ) that had just gotten a huge insurance payment or had more money than other people and being their security ( because they lived in the ghetto and all IV drug addicts usually know each other in area) I lived off of a best friend of mine who also was a lesbian                        Because people judge.

No questions asked. I have adopted my friend’s method; and put a dollar in an outside pocket each day.

Everyone has their own ‘hustle’ or ways to get the money; but it’s nearly always about the same story. (I’m talking about opiate (Heroin) addiction). One of the common things is to simply deal. There are dealers out there (and plenty of them) that “Don’t get high on their own supply”. For every one of these dealers there are many (MANY!) that simply sell to feed their own addiction.

It’s hard to understand; but a person who is addicted to a substance (or a behavior; for that matter) has undergone fundamental changes in their brain structure; specifically; the reward pathways in the brain have begun to overpower most of the other cognitive functions. Essentially; an addicted person’s brain places drugs on the same level as food; air; or sleep; an instinct-driven necessity for survival.

I don’t spend any of it on drugs; though. If I did; I would be spending it on Zoloft to control my severe depression and anxiety; and Metformin to control my diabetes. I live in my car and manage to afford a hotel room once a week to lie down in a bed and take a shower. My “diet” consists of eating pre-cooked sausage and hot dogs. Most of the week I don’t shower; brush my teeth; etc. because I don’t have easy access to those facilities. I change clothes in the driver’s seat of my car because there’s no other place to do so.

Most Americans just don't give a damn. Calling them all junkies is one more way to blame them and make yourself feel better. Yes; some are addicts. Many are also mentally ill people left to fend for themselves. Basically these are sick people left out in the cold.  The main drug of choice is alcohol. If you can't get change to buy it; you can shoplift it; or shoplift roll on deodorant or rubbing alcohol. If you strain deodorant; it's 80 proof alcohol but tastes terrible. If you chase rubbing alcohol with dairy; They hustle.

Meth addicts are seen as the worst of the worst and thus they often hang with; support or parasitize each other.

Something within you is painful and you don't want to deal with it. So you cover it up with drugs. But sounds le the addiction is full blown now; where you are causing even more pain; now with your loved ones. Piling up the pain; because the original pain; is left undealt with. The root of most addictions is the feeling of shame; admitting to something or some behavior of the past that it was wrong; will allow you to release pain. Your loved ones and God are holding your hand as you walk through this and          Stop trying to quit and start the doing that is necessary to quit. Make a solid decision to quit and stick with it.

The fact that you asked shows a willingness to learn and try; also openness and a desire to understand. It is incredibly powerful that you asked “how to help people with addiction” rather than “how to help addicts.” 2. Have Compassion or empathy for the person. As stated above; the way you phrased your question shows that you still see the person. Often in our society; we think of; and refer to; people who are addicted as addicts. Lumping people together this way is the first step to dehumanizing. Which leads to a complete lack of compassion

It wasn't nearly as difficult as one might think; nor did it really take very long. As my addiction deepened; I went from: (please note none of this is meant to sound self-aggrandizing. It's just the reality that I created for myself with the help of cocaine). The above turned into:       What do you mean “wasted”? You see; most of my money I have spent on drugs or women. The rest I wasted. The way you have worded this question tells me that you don’t think drugs are important enough to spend money on. But I have to tell you; drugs are pretty important to a drug addict. For someone like me; drugs are the first thing I consider when budgeting my money. I always make sure that I don’t run out of drugs. If I ran out; there would be problems. Not just problems for me; I’m talking problems for other people who will soon notice things missing from their yard or mailbox. Seriously; you d

This is because drugs are illegal; and therefore scarce and insanely expensive. Most drugs that people abuse or become addicted to are actually very inexpensive to manufacture. Such goodies as heroin; meth; and cocaine cost pennies per dose to make. They are astronomically expensive because they are illegal. As a result; many people cannot support their habit by working a job. They must steal; or sell something; usually illegal. They sell drugs; stolen property; or their own asses to make the mon      (Currently not working due to the winter season and renovations have slowed down significantly; plus my boss is spending the winter with his family in Cuba; lucky bastard).

You got clean because you chose to do it. Be proud of yourself and move on. You don’t have to prove anything to anyone but you. Stay sober and move forward with your life.As a recovering addict; I can relate to this. But one of the things you have to keep in mind is that you didn't burn bridges overnight; and you can't repair them that quickly either. I don't know your story; so I can't assume; but for me; I put my family through hell. I lied to them multiple times. I lied about using drugs; I lied about what I needed to borrow money for; I lied about what those marks were on my arms—I lied constantly. I destroyed their trust in me. I made family events awkward.

It happens slowly; you don’t want to become one; nobody does. First you start on the weekends; for some fun. Then it starts out every day; and if you’re doing opiates - you will get so fucking sick without an opiate.

For me the most difficult part are judgmental people that have no clue about drugs; addiction or the fact that there are several street drugs that have Pharmaceutical grad legal doppelgängers.

Let me ask you a question; what's the best feeling you've ever experienced?

Have you ever jumped out of a The person cares deeply; is wracked with guilt; and desires to be free of their chains and do right by the ones they love.

In my experiences it happens in one of a few ways usually. Now; of course there is the situation of being thrown out by family and friends; or going to jail and being released to nothing. But what I usually see is there is a growing lack of funds and the landlord sends you on your way; usually with unpaid utility bills as well. Most addicts and alcoholics are fairly good and dependable workers as they need their paycheck to fund their using. However; sooner or later; as they sink further in to the addicted lifestyle; job perform

First; you probably won't hear me say very often that I've beat addiction; because I haven't. If I do say that; it's by mistake. I still fight addiction every single day. I still go to counciling. I still take meds that I'll most likely be on for my entire life; unless a cure for opiate addiction is discovered. I still have days where I do struggle. They have just gotten easier for me to deal with and fewer and further apart. Here's what got me here though. I won't go into why I first got into the program I'm in and stuff. I've wrote about that in anot          It’s awful. It’s the worst thing you could go through besides grief. Whether you love an addict or are one; there are no words to describe the unimaginable pain. Your love will never be enough for an addict to get clean. I am a drug addict. It happens slowly; you don’t want to become one; nobody does. First you start on the weekends; for some fun. Then it starts out every day; and if you’re doing opiates - you will get so fucking sick without an opiate. The thing with opiates is you HAVE to get through the brutal withdrawal to get off of them; no matter what. If you’re on maintenance; you’re e     
https://www.quora.com/Why-do-drug-addicts-demand-help,Why do drug addicts demand help,The same way someone who has a medical problem will demand or ask for help. I do not like using the word drug addict; so those who are addicted or dependent on drugs have a chemical dependence. They are no longer controlling the substance; but the substance is now controlling them. It is a good thing that they would reach out for help; as opposed to continuing using. With the opioid and fentanyl epidemic; it is understandable why substance abuse users are reaching out for help. They want help; they need help; and they do not want to die.Have you ever seen a Benzodiazepine withdrawal? They go into something called delirium tremens and it is an acute situation we are talking convulsions until they are better or they are dead. Have you ever seen a Heroin withdrawal? You puke your guts out and shit your breeches; your legs have thousands of insects crawling over your nerve endings that makes your legs jump up and down. Have you ever seen a stimulant withdrawal? You go into such a dark depression that you think you will never find your way out; my own brother turns violent we are talking beating up his best friend cause well reasons

https://www.quora.com/How-do-heroin-addicts-afford-their-habit,How do heroin addicts afford their habit,A number of false and harmful stereotypes are around about this. Addiction can be thought of as “dependency PLUS harm”. It is easy to become dependent on drugs of the opioid class - it can take as little as four days use before becoming liable to a very uncomfortable and miserable withdrawal syndrome. To avoid the withdrawal syndrome; further use stops the symptoms in their tracks. However; tolerance to this class of drugs can build rapidly; and soon one may find oneself having to ingest ever greater quantities at ever greater expense; simply in order not to get sick.

There’s a lot of odd skills we have that are not very useful otherwise. The biggest thing; and something that makes you invaluable; is that you know what it’s like. From whenever you started to now; trying to stop; stopping; going back to it; what’s actually hard about every step of the way. Psychologically; addiction is all very similar. A person with heightened compassion and senses; usually more intelligent than average; a higher awareness of metaphysical issues. Hard to       Humility and strength would be my top two. Overcoming addiction comes with unbelievable humility. Addicts have seen and done a lot of shameful things. When they kick their habit; they are able to relate to others in a way that no one else could unless they have had an addiction. They are able to better help others without judgment. Former addicts don't just sympathize; they empathize because they have been there a time or too. Strength because there is not a lot out there that is stronger than someone who has battled and conquered a brain disease such as addiction.

They seek better job prospects or come to the city in the hope to changing the way they live. They do have jobs - odd jobs; contract jobs that don’t pay long-term on in continuity so it’s kind of tough to have enough to pay rent on any form of shelter because that’s a fixed expense. b) Homeless people can be elderly people or fiercely proud people who chose to leave their children’s homes because they do not wish to be a burden to them.

It simply feeds their addiction. If you have an addict in your life the best thing for you to do is detach. Detaching will protect yourself as well as send a glaring message to the addict that you are well aware of their addiction and you will not tolerate it. By detaching the addict is forced to take a look at their addiction. I know that it hurt me when my loved ones detached from me. It made me see how bad off I truly was. When you can see where addiction has taken Nothing. When I would like aka need you or anyone else to understand anything about my recovery from alcoholism that word need mutates into a faulty dependency. Quite simply when I need anything I’m afraid.

I was a heroin addict. I’ve been sober for a few years now; but I’m still ashamed of what I’ve done. I became a stripper. At first I was okay with it. It paid my rent and got me enough to get drugs. As time went on I started to hate it. Nasty men always groping me. Men touching me in places that even though I would tell them they were not allowed to; they wouldn’t listen and do it anyway. Being begged to go back to their hotel room after my shift ended. After a bit of time; I would cry every day before going to work. I hated my life. The drugs didn’t last m I have done some things I’ve regretted and been ashamed of; but nothing like this. When I was a teenager living on the streets in San Francisco; I had a friend named Marc who had left home in New York and came all the way across the country with nothing and no one to live on the streets in SF. Why did he do this? His dad was a heroin addict. His dad couldn’t keep up with his habit; so he would find men that wanted to have sex for money. Only his dad didn’t have sex with them. He brought them home and forced his son to! My poor; broken friend was pimped out by his own father for 5 years; ages 8

She wouldn’t call in the prescription before finding out what my co-pay would be as she considered it to be very expensive. It was $45 without insurance. So some care; some don’t.Sometimes. Doctors know that generics will cost less than name brand. They will also have a good idea on the costlier medications based on release date (newer medications are usually more money). A pediatrician working with a largely low income population will know to prescribe Amoxicillin ($0-$3) over Azithromycin ($??).

Steer clear from CVS. Especially if it involves controlled substance medications. All big chain pharmacies; from my experience; are very deceptive and don’t have any morals. If a physician has ordered said medication to that specific pharmacy they have an obligation to dispense the drug. That said; they are also notorious for stalling; “claiming” that the drug isn’t in stock/is on back order and I’ve seen plenty of patients come into our pharmacy complaining about the big 4 refusing to dispense their prescriptions.

Same thing when you are getting the refill at your yearly physical visit (when your insurance covers the physical) and no blood tests are required.

Some were based on direct cost. some based on wholesale. This was before the advent of most having insurance. Now most prices are determined by insurance carriers and God forbid you go into most chains and pay straight up cash; that’s why these GoodRx and other discount cards are so prevalent.

It was the AWP (average wholesale price) plus a percentage markup; commonly 50%. 50% sounds high; but the wholesale price of drugs was low and 50% of a low price amounted to a fairly low amount per prescription. Often the pharmacy would make more than the 50% since they would commonly order direct from the manufacturer instead of the wholesaler; saving the difference. This is no longer done.

Because those events involve hospitalization and are expensive to manage; third party payers are willing to pay some money to avoid them.

I remember when I first moved to Las Vegas from New Mexico; the price of the medication I was taking jumped from $8.50 to $15. Coincidentally; my new health insurance had a $15 copay. Walgreens used to hand me my meds along with a leaflet urging me to thank the insurance companies for making medicines affordable. I was offended by the insufferable odor of bullshit; so I moved my prescription to a different pharmacy - and they charged me the uninsured retail price of $8.50. So I guess the answer to the question is; because they can.Really; pharmacies should generally not be charging you more as a cash client than what they bill insurance. The pharmacy should be billing the insurance; Part D or Medicaid program what is called “Usual & Customary” (U&C). I have seen pharmacies that have free or deeply discounted generics (this is less common these days) that charge insurance for those medications. Since their U&C price is $4 ; they should be charging $4 to the insurance; but they know that insurance will likely pay $5 for that medication; so they charge $10.

Generally the ingredients used won't change the price; a gram of shit MDMA is going to cost the same as a gram of good MDMA because dealers aren't selling based on their capital costs they are pricing based on the market. They know that their customers don't know whats in their product and therefore; to the addict; there is no way of telling if a gram of MDMA is going to be shit or good.

Alot of people I used to hang out with got addicted to pain pills. Escalated from drugs like Norco to harder opiods like Morphine and Oxycontin. But the price of strong prescription opiods is expensive; that coupled with an increased tollerance lead them to the point they couldn't afford their prescription drug habit. So in the eyes of someone addicted to a drug their body now NEEDS to function (without feeling like dying) they had to find a solution.

That would mean no profit at all for the provider and therefore the provider agrees on lower prices because low profits are better than no profits.

The cost of developing the drug is actually irrelevant at this point; the development cost is fixed (a sunk cost ) and has already been spent. As such; it should* not influence the market price.

Unfortunately the Insurance led healthcare in the US places the insurance companies at the helm of determining which drugs go into market and permit the ridiculous costs.

The short version is that during the Second World War; there was a wage freeze. As companies still needed to compete for employees; some added health insurances as benefit of employment. Prior to this; being a doctor; while a good living; was not a “two Jaguars and a country club membership living.” Post-war; the population was generally younger and healthier; so the insurers made money hand over fist.

The end result is that it takes years and billions of dollars[1] to get a drug approved - that is; unless another company blocks you with a patent suit and you have to spend more years and billions of dollars just to restart the process. This creates a market in which the price of admission is huge; which encourage everyone to keep the end price high in order to recover their investment.

So when there’s a conflict between making something cheaply and making something safe; guess which one wins? But I’m straying from my point.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has found that tobacco costs Americans roughly $295 billion each year and $130 billion alone in healthcare costs. But as mentioned earlier; there are also many health costs associated. #2 Alcohol Alcohol is the second costliest drug in the United States.

On average; however; it is widely recognized that bringing a new drug to market is an expensive and time-consuming endeavor. As of my last knowledge update in 2021; it was estimated to cost roughly $2.8 billion to develop and gain regulatory approval for a new prescription drug. Here are some key cost components involved in drug development:    Drug patents are for 20 years. It takes about 12 years to do the development and two years for FDA review.

Cocaine is synthesized from the leaves of the coca plant to form a paste. This paste is further synthesized and cut with adulterant substances to make it into street-level cocaine that can be injected; snorted or smoked. To make the paste; there is a process of extracting the cocaine that includes the use of toxic chemicals. There are two main ways that the cocaine paste is made: solvent extraction and acid extraction.

https://www.quora.com/Is-the-high-cost-of-drugs-to-offset-R-D-costs-justified,Is the high cost of drugs to offset R D costs justified,I think the answer to this is a qualified yes. However; there are a lot of inequities in drug pricing that don't make sense. The ability to patent and make a drug exclusive for a period of time has undoubtedly led to more effective drugs coming to the market. In addition; although drugs are often expensive; surgery or other alternatives may bed considerably more expensive and risky to the patient. For example; statins to lower blood pressure are relatively expensive; since they need to be taken for a lifetime; but are far cheaper and less dangerous than a heart transplant or open-heart surgery       Should the price of drugs be based on the investment in R&D related to them? In the current setting; the reality is that they are. After 12 years of R&D; a pharmaceutical company has a limited window to recoup the costs of R&D and make a profit (let’s not forget it’s a commercial enterprise with an eye on shareholder value) before the drug patent expires and generic manufacturers are free to make and sell the same drugs at a fraction of the price. It’s not the pharmaceutical industry’s fault – we; as society; ask the industry to undertake years of extensive clinical testing; meaning that a pr

So that is tautologically correct; but generally mistaken! Majority of drugs are the grit of labor of public funded academic research of researchers; dedicated selflessly to understanding and combatting disease and disabilities.

Developing a *new* drug is not really a matter of huge expense; it’s a matter of having good medical scientists; well done studies; and TIME. It seems to be enough to have one lead scientist; and one to two junior scientists. Tweaks to pharmaceuticals are done incrementally as a rule; from what I’ve heard.

They are operated to make as much money as possible; that is job #1. So when there’s a conflict between making something cheaply and making something safe; guess which one wins? But I’m straying from my point. Pharma products are priced based on what the market will bear; so the US system of “health insurance” is a gold mine for them; the market is no longer driven by the finances of individuals; it now taps a collective with very deep pockets. Without “insurance” who would be able to pay $125K for a round o        I think you may actually be asking why are people in US paying more for drugs than other countries. There are several reasons.

Pharmacies and wholesalers take advantage of this knowledge and buy as much inventory as possible in December at the “old price”. Then in January insurance companies pay the new higher prices and wholesalers also charge the new price. The average historical price increase has been 9 percent and thus drug Yes; this is a big problem. Drug companies; like any business will charge the highest amount possible for their product.

The US is also one of the few westernized nations that doesn’t have universal health care and many don’t have any sort of health care support wind up paying full price for medicine. Additionally; the US government (taxpayers) contribute heavily towards research and development for new drugs that wind up becoming profitable products for drug companies. Over-all; I would say that the US needs price controls.Why is medication so expensive in the United States? Because government allows pharmaceutical companies to charge whatever they want for the drugs people need to survive or avoid suffering. And of course people pay because the only alternative is death and suffering. In single payer systems prices can be significantly lowered by negotiation because providers can simply be removed from the provider pool of a certain health care product or service. That would mean no profit at all for the provider and therefore the provider agrees on lower prices because low profits are better than no profits.

But now the part of the answer some people contest; the reason pharmaceutical companies have extremely high margins (profit) is that they cannot include research and development into the Profit/loss balance sheet. In example; if you spend 300MM dollars on research only to have the drug not ge It’s complicated. Actual cost of production tends not to be the major expense for a new drug; which has required years of R&D plus expensive clinical trials to come to market at all. Plus; pharmaceutical companies tend to have more drug candidates fail to make to market than to succeed. Eventually production cost becomes the dominant cost; but not initially. Then there’s the matter of where the drug is being sold. In a country with low average incomes or where the government negotiates drug prices or both; what a company can charge for a drug and still sell it is going to be constrained. So fo

The pharmaceutical manufactures are captain of the ship. They are the ones who decide what price they will sell their product for. They also are the ones who do all of the direct to comsumer advertising which; sometimes; causes a increase in use of a new; higher priced; product.

We pay more for our drugs than any other country in the world. Most companies have some sort of government agency that sets prices for drugs in their country. In addition; unlike in the US; companies are forced to prove their drug is superior to the current drugs available in that country. Not only does it need to be superior but the price must be in line with other agents in that therapeutic class.They are honest about being a business and wanting to make as much as possible.

It essentially comes down to the way that every industry prices their products - by figuring out how much people are willing to pay for it. Early on in development of a drug; companies will develop a target product profile (basically a list of what they think the drug will do; in terms of how it’s administered; how often; how effective it will be; what kinds of safety problems are likely to be associated with it). Then people from payer organizations; whether they be national single payers ; or corporate payers; are shown the     I’ll summarize; but will be happy to elaborate if asked.

Evidence that will help justify a higher price includes a meaningfully superior safety and efficacy profile; generally taken from interventional clinical trials; and superior value profile; generally based on retrospective observational comparative effectiveness research.

There are a number of identifiable causes; and I will cite examples where possible. 1) Constriction of supply. Health care is one of those interesting problems in economics where it's essential enough that a significant number of people will go for anything that might help at any cost. While in a normal market; ""anything that might help at any cost"" doesn't lead to massive price ramps because high margins with high volumes draw in competitors who undercut each other; in health care it doesn't because supply is constricted in various ways.

What can be done about them is what nations that pay ZERO to see a doctor and pay ZERO to have anything done in a hospital; which is to make health insurance companies illegal; as we did when we began universal single payer health care nationwide 57 years ago.

I called the billing department to inform them and also to say that my husband did have the condition required for coverage. I expected them to verify that with the doctor and correct the claim.

My husband and I were single income; about 27;000 a year. Medicaid covered everything necessary throughout my pregnancy; labor; and delivery; even post partum care. I asked for a breakdown of my hospital bill for when I gave birth and some of the shocking amounts on it were….. Almost $400 for “feeding; clothing; and diapering” expenses…. What? A few cheap receiving blankets; a cheap hat; NO FEEDING because I was breastfeeding; and roughly 20 diapers and some wipes? $800 ballpark for a “breastfeeding consult” from a regular OB        I was in my early 20s doing judo in Southern California and got thrown pretty hard on the mat. Also the big fella who threw me happened to land on top of my chest and compressed it pretty good. Afterwards I was experiencing pain while breathing and thought maybe I cracked a rib or sternum. I drove myself to the ER to get myself checked out. I had to wait 2+ hours after arrival. Fine I wasn’t dying. I got X-Rayed; got seen by a doctor; and she told me nothing was broken and gave me a handful of OTC pain relievers and sent me on my way.

I would have gone home after a couple of days but the ileus kept me in the hospital. I just had to wait it out. I refused pain medication. I could neither eat nor drink. I received no real therapy of any kind. I was just sitting in the hospital bed; staring out the window. I was there for one week. When I returned home; I got a bill from the hospital; for just the room. It was $700;000. I was sure it was a mistake. I called and was informed that it was not a mistake.                    I went into labor at 24 weeks. I spent several hours in one hospital; and then traveled via ambulance to another where I spent one week in active labor they kept stopping with magnesium sulfate until it became toxic to me. My daughter was born at 25 weeks; a micro-preemie. She stayed at the hospital for about a month before she was transferred to a specialty children’s hospital for heart surgery.

Walk through any ICU and you'll routinely see some people in vegetative conditions with virtually no chance of getting better.

Ask for a break down of the bill (what things cost)! You might find they charged you $10 for a ten cent band aid; etc. They often do things like this to re-coop the cost of people who didn’t pay their bills. I would then suggest negotiating with them. Tell them look; I only make $30k a year (or whatever) so there is absolutely no way I can afford $100k. You might offer $2k as payment in full.

Cost depends highly on location for starters. In certain locations and regions in the world; some patients are lucky enough not have to worry at all about the cost of their healthcare. I currently live in the U.S. where healthcare is among the highest in the world. The answer to this question can vary vastly across the spectrum. Lets go through a few fees (these can vary greatly but this is a rough estimate during my time with patients in the ER). Starting off first is how you get to the hospital. An ambulance depends on distance traveled;  One of the benefits of coming from a country with universal healthcare is that I rarely have to think about the cost of medical treatment; either when a recipient; or as a healthcare worker. I never have to worry that I won't be able to afford treatment should I fall ill; nor that I would have to turn patients away.

That is true for most things. However; one area where that rule doesn’t usually hold is prescription drugs. That is a longer discussion. Insurance coverage for drugs works a tad differently than for medical services. Sometimes; the cash price for a prescription can be lower than the quoted co-pay. However; it is the case that most healthy people in the U.S. spend more on their medical insurance; deductibles; and copays than if they simply paid for their medical servi       Since most/all insurances decide how much a certain procedure; office visit; treatment; etc. should cost and may also have negotiated rates of reimbursement with major providers/hospitals; many medical providers/hospitals will accept that amount as payment in full. If a person has a deductible or share-of-cost type of insurance; then a provider/hospital may separately bill him/her for the additional amount; but still it’s more than likely the total paid will add up to less than a person without insurance will be charged.

They will cover them. They should have told you that when you applied. Anything older than that is still your responsibility. Talk to a social worker at the hospital. Many have foundations that will help pay the bills of the uninsured or under insured. Some will allow a long term payment plan with small monthly payments. If they are astronomical; you may have to declare bankruptcy; but get advice from a bankruptcy attorney before you do so; as there are long-term repercussions.Don't pay them. If you're so poor as to have qualified for Medicaid; I can't imagine you're trying to protect a stellar credit score. Let the debt sit and do nothing. There's nothing much they can do to you if you have no assets or income other than ding your credit. And medical debt is explainable; understandable and not held against you. Throw the statements away. Block any collection agencies. Literally don't give the old bills another thought. Very little if anything will happen to you. Carry on.

On average an estimated 30% of life insurance payouts in the US goes to paying off medical bills incured in the person's last year of life. Also; end of life medical expenses do tend to be high; but not insanely so. In the US about 13% of medical spending is in the last year of life; and in the UK it's about 11% this is certainly higher than an average year; since life expectancy is 78–81 in those countries.The point of insurance (and actuary tables) is to amortize the total expected cost of people and turn it into a regular payment so that when the costs do occur; you have properly paid for it over time. Let me give you an example. Let’s say that every person has a 99% chance of costing you $1000 and 1% chance of $10 000 over their life times. If you have 100 people; then over their life times you expect that the total cost would be about $109 000. Then let’s say a life time is 100 years. Then if everyone pays $1090 per year (or $10.90 per year per person) then everything is paid for. Of course; th

I picked him up and took him to the hospital. It took an hour or so for the ER to admit him. They finally admitted him; and the ER doctor classified it as a “partial amputation”.

We hear a lot about how great American healthcare is in America. We get to choose our own doctors; wait-times for appointments are low; and expensive procedures are more readily available than in nationalized systems. According to my own research; that seems absolutely true for wealthy A           Yes. Because I am a “bleeding heart” liberal? No. Because I am afraid that healthcare costs scare people into having fewer children? No. Because I am sick? No. Because members of my family died due to lack of healthcare or insurance? No. Because I am a hard-headed capitalist who likes to optimize. Just think:

The US has incredibly expensive health care. I mean incredibly expensive. Health care is one of the biggest for-profit industries in the country. A long time ago; some enterprising capitalists figured out that if you sell a product that people have to have or they will literally die; if you conceal the price of the product; and if you design the product in such a way that people can’t comparison shop; you can charge any price you want. As a result; well… A few weeks ago; I slipped with a razor knife and cut myself at the base of my thumb. I needed four stitches. The stitches we                      I am hungry. Let’s go shopping.

About a mile away; local store Z is selling it for $1.48 per lb. All things being equal; that is to say; chicken is chicken; I suspect most of us would go to store Z. Why don’t we try something different. Not everyone eats chicken…at least not daily or even once a week. I have a lot of money and I am going to do something interesting. Why not sell food insurance.

Even with financial help from the Hospital; the Orthopedics' just writing off the last part of bill. I made payments for years.

In my case; I pay a premium for Medicare and a premium for a supplemental insurance. My supplemental covers the portion that Medicare does not pay so I have no additional medical bills.Yes; but if you have a Medicare Supplement Plan G (the most comprehensive you can get if you became eligible for Medicare in 2020 or later) all you have to pay is the first $240 (in 2024) of Part B charges for the year and for your Part D outpatient medicine copays.

We don’t have any chronic health conditions and there are a lot of exclusions in the coverage for different testing s and all.

I would rather pay that in taxes and have single-payer healthcare like modern societies. I don’t understand why pushing the cost of healthcare on emp   Good question. My deductible is $4000. We pay over $400 a month for it. There’s also co-pays required even after we meet the $4000 deductible. I MISS CANADA!

https://www.quora.com/What-are-high-deductible-health-plans-Are-they-worth-the-money-you-save-on-premiums,What are high deductible health plans Are they worth the money you save on premiums,As the name implies; they are health plans that require you to pay a relatively large amount out-of-pocket before the insurance pays anything. Are they worth it? If you are “normal” or “average”; and paying your own insurance premiums; yes; particularly if you take the money you save in premiums and invest it in an HSA. Sit down and run the numbers. For the same policy with the same network and benefits; but comparing a HD plan with a more standard plan list these figures for each choice. 1) the premiums—the amount you know you have to pay every month 2) what you will have to pay out-of-pocket An easy way to check is to go to Welcome to Medicare and check out the Supplemental plans. The website provides the costs of each type of plan. In my specific case; my husband is on High Deductible Plan F. Plan F is the most costly of the supplemental plans. When I enrolled him in his plan in 2017; his High Deductible Plan F cost $42/month. Now in 2023; his HDF costs $50 a month. Contrast that with my Plan G. I have a deductible of $266 (in 2023) compared to his $2700 high deductible. My plan costs $160 a month. If you’re thinking of health plans for non-Medicare recipients; your high deductible

Here in the province of British Columbia (in Canada) our Basic health coverage is free; and that includes all Dr’s Visits; all medical procedures; and all hospital stays. Generally; - if a Dr. prescribes it - it’s free. My stress tests; colonoscopies (I’m 77) eye exams; etc. are all covered. Cancer treatments are 100% covered (no matter what the cost to the province).

https://www.quora.com/Why-do-doctors-charge-so-high,Why do doctors charge so high,Well; let me tell you about my experience as a Hong Kong citizen. An average doctor in Hong Kong charges you at least $500 (Around $65 USD) for a basic diagnosis; not including the medicine; which costs you on average $50 for some extra pills. I once went to a doctor due to headache and was charged around $600 HKD (Around 76 USD) for some paracetamol and a doctor's certificate that wasn't even worth the paper it was printed on.   In the United States; doctor salaries are actually not even 5% of the “total cost of health care.” Which is why the public and lawmakers never understand that cutting reimbursement to doctors will only discourage young people to join the profession. Unfortunately we are an easy target. Yes; like others said; it takes at least 11 years after high school and hundreds of thousands of dollars; and sacrificing your 20s to get there. Many people don't mind paying a plumber or mechanic hundreds or thousands or dollars for sometimes easy work; but doctors should work for free.

There are many websites now where you can engage directly with a doctor or other Healthcare Professional in a one on one manner. This can be done via Skype although in my experience Skype is less satisfactory than email exchange. The thing about Skype; just as in face to face consultation; is that neither party is given the time and space to consider their questions and answers. The great thing about email exchange is that everyone has the time to consider their questions and answers. In many ways this can be more effective than face to face consultation.

If you’re at the poverty level; a pack of cigarettes per day can consume 10% of your family’s monthly income. Even worse; if you’re a heavy substance abuser; you might even be spending half or more of your monthly income on drugs. Addiction can even create poverty in future generations. Due to your drug habits; your children may receive inadequate education and struggle with budgeting and time management. They may even mimic your habits and develop addictions themselves; something no one wants for their children. Addiction is hea                      It’s awful. It’s the worst thing you could go through besides grief. Whether you love an addict or are one; there are no words to describe the unimaginable pain. Your love will never be enough for an addict to get clean. I am a drug addict. It happens slowly; you don’t want to become one; nobody does. First you start on the weekends; for some fun.

You'll always need a stream of income to pay for them; and most likely that number will grow over the years as your tolerance grows. The thing is; drugs can get you through college or provide you with more creativity but at some point they become more of a burden than a help. There are certainly many successful addicts who do not have cash flow problems. I think the real question is; is this your most happy and self-actualized existence?Some of us work our asses off; some of us steal; some of us rob; some of us sell our bodies; some sell our possessions; borrow money from friends and family and some of us sell drugs to support our habits. Collecting disability and other government benefits is another way to support our habits. Drug users are not inherently bad people; not one person I know just woke up one morning and said “I think im gonna shoot up some heroin”.

However; tolerance to this class of drugs can build rapidly; and soon one may find oneself having to ingest ever greater quantities at ever greater expense; simply in order not to get sick. Because of spiralling costs;

For example of tube of cream for medical purposes. It costs $9 in the United States. In Canada it is regulated and costs only $5; in Mexico the same tube cost 90cents. And where are all these made? In the same factory in the United States. They can make a profit at 90cents a tube; but charge Americans $9 per tube Costs in the United States are so high simply because Americans will pay that much. Its a free market economy; companies can charge what the market will bear. In Canada; drug costs are usually lower because Canada grants 10 years of patent protection versus 5 yea    Here is a very basic statistic. Compared to any other First World country; US healthcare costs at least double what the same level of healthcare would cost in any other country. This is just simply; a fact. So putting it another way; if you needed a surgery; or some medication; or some other medical attention; by going to the country with the next highest cost for healthcare; you could save 50% over what the procedure would cost in the US. If you went to a country where healthcare was even less expensive; you would save even more. So yes; it is entirely possible to spend the money to travel to an

Techniques learned in one vaccine method are easily translated to other problems in vaccines. At the other front; NIDA is at the forefront of clinical psych because; lets admit it; drug abuse is the product of a mental unbalance. To fully understand the neurological mechanisms of addiction and the impairment of control and restraint is of huge interest to the medical Drug abuse also costs this country lots of money. Drug-related crime and injury is a burden on both our prison system and our health system. Imagine if there was a way to pro    I would ask the question differently: why don't we redistribute the DEA's budget so that NIDA gets; let's say $10B instead of whatever it's getting now out of the DEA's $20B+ annual budget. Right now most of the DEA's budget goes to the fruitless and demonstrably failed efforts at interdiction.
https://www.quora.com/Is-money-a-drug,Is money a drug,Money is merely a means of exchange; but I think it’s fair to argue that lifestyle is a drug. Whenever our lifestyle improves; it makes us happier for a brief moment. Our things are shinier; our food is tastier; our slippers are more comfortable. Then as we become accustomed to it; we need that lifestyle to stay at our current level of contentedness; and we need even more to make us happier. Take it away and we go through withdrawals. Money can do wonderful things; but improving your lifestyle is just creating a habit you’ll have to feed later.Yes it is. It is the drug of security; money is just the numbers and symbols (coins and notes) that represents to a human their level of ‘security’; however it’s a false means of trust; as it can be taken in a second. I am not perfect at this; cheapness and tightness can also be an addiction. no matte how much you earn; spending habits need to be made conscious; you may have millions but still carry scarcity in everything you do. It feels wonderful to be able to spend; however it will never cover the insecurity you harbour. Only being yourself or self realisation can do such a thing; so that yo

I kept waiting for the sarcastic reveal. The fact that they were meant in earnest…frightens me.    The free market hasn’t brought healthcare costs down in America because we don’t HAVE a free market in health care. You might as well ask why President Hillary Clinton didn’t give us universal health care since she was elected in 2016. Since Hillary wasn’t elected; she couldn’t give us universal health care. Instead of a free market; we have; even before Obamacare; Medicare and Medicaid pumping tens of billions of dollars into the health care system. Increasing the amount of money spent on goods and services increases their price. We have the American Medical Association which acts as a doctor’s

Spending On Prescription Drugs In The US: Where Does All The Money Go? has a good summary U.S. total medicine spending 2002-2016 | Statistic provides a rough estimate to 1. This is in the ballpark of $450 billion. Total spending in the US            Because we let them. Read that again. Because WE let them. Medicare Part D specifically PROHIBITS the negotiation of drug prices. (Some Big Pharma lobbyist; somewhere; broke out the champagne and got a huge bonus for that one.) Just about every other country in the world; where universal health care exists; negotiates their drug costs. Those countries know that saying that the system pays only X dollars for Y drug means that effectively; that drug won’t go anyone in that country; unless Big Pharma plays ball.

I think a gram of pure; uncut heroin would cost about $20; but taxes would be obsene perhaps quadrupling the price or more. I believe cheap; legal heroin would reduce drug seeking crime. If for no other reason than that heroine would be cheaper. Crime associated with the illicit production and distribution would be reduced because it simply wouldn’t be profitable to compete with cheap; potent; legal heroine. There would be a lot of overdoses while junkies adapt to a pure product; h  Heroin is made from morphine; which naturally occurs in plant called opium/breadsead poppy.

I will admit there are a lot out there that do steal and do bad things to get money for drugs. However; I wouldn’t say that it’s a catch all by any means. I personally have never stolen from anyone; even at my worst when addicted to dope. I sold a lot of my own shit to support my habit; but I drew the line at harming others. I could live with myself that way; and not have a guilty conscience about how I got them. I’d rather be in horrible withdrawals that do anything hurtful to my friends or family.

It was titled; “Throw Some D’s On That Bitch” and had a cover photo of her in a swimsuit. When I clicked on the description; it went something like this: “Since I am about to graduate college; I am giving myself a boob job as a graduation present. As Richboy (a rapper) said; I would like to “Throw Some D’s (boobs) on That Bitch (me).” Basically I am tired of looking like a 12 year old boy when I take my shirt off so I believe breast augmentation is necessary for me.

They also have a 2.9% (plus some change/transaction) fee; which is reasonable. But a tip? The options they give you to check; for a tip; are like you’re dining in a restaurant. Still the fee; as far as I can tell; is what’s customary for charitable giving these days. And I’m pretty sure it covers the credit card company’s cut.

The family wanted a funeral and burial that would ho     Starting or managing your fundraising on GoFundMe is free of charge. However; a tiny transaction fee (2.9% plus $0.30; which covers debit and credit costs) is taken out for operational security.

Rehab is only a temporary solution for a permanent problem. Quitting is easy.
